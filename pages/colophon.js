            <Title3>Growth Stages</Title3>
            <p>
              Every post on this site has a <b>growth stage</b>. Everything
              starts as a reasonably unopinionated note (as much as that's
              possible â€“ I'm a cultural relativist at heart and question the
              idea of pure, objective knowledge).
            </p>
            <p>
              Notes begin as seedlings, grow into buddings, and finally reach an
              evergreen stage. Some of them go on to become essays if I feel I
              have a clear opinion on the topic.
            </p>
            <Title3>Custom Components</Title3>
            <p>
              I've built a number of reusable custom components for various
              situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's the <i>coming soon</i> component that signals a post is
              half-written and needs to be finished in the future:
              <ComingSoon />
            </p>
            <p>
              There's an <i>assumed audience</i> component that I put at the top
              of some posts to make explicit who I'm writing for:
              <AssumedAudience>
                People who care about how websites are built.
              </AssumedAudience>
            </p>
            <p>
              I occassionally need to <i>alert</i> readers to dangers and
              threats:
              <Alert>
                <h2>This is an alert</h2>
                <p>
                  Stay vigiliant to the threat of typography that is too small
                  and low contrast to read.
                </p>
              </Alert>
            </p>
            <p>
              Some are simply nicely styled callouts for books:
              <ResourceBook
                url="https://www.librarything.com/work/9697447"

                Addiction by Design takes readers into the intriguing world of
                machine gambling, an increasingly popular and absorbing form of
                play that blurs the line between human and machine, compulsion
                and control, risk and reward.
