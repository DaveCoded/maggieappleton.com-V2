Now pages are more stable than a twitter feed and less permanent than the [about](/about) page. Life updates on a monthly rather than daily or hourly cadence.<Footnote idName={1}>Now pages are a [growing thing](https://nownownow.com/about). You can make one for yourself.</Footnote>

### October 2021

After five years working with [egghead](egghead.io), I decided it was time to move on. I started as an illustrator in early 2016. By 2018 I had moved into an art director and leadership role. By 2020 I'd shifted to focusing on UX and product design.

I grew up in this company, but over the last year it's become clear I need/want to enagage more in the rising “tools for thought” ecosystem. I've now joined [HASH](hash.ai) as the design lead. We're working on building a knowledge management platform (aka. “note taking app") backed by schemas and structured data.

### August 2021

With lockdown easing in London I've spent most of summer outside throwing tennis balls around in the park, rather than sitting in front of screens writing words. It's been a good break, but I've missed researching. The British winter will descend again soon and I'll be back inside tending to the digital garden.

[Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/) and I finally launched [Just JavaScript](https://justjavascript.com/) after 2 years of work. It's an interactive book that teaches JavaScript with a specific focus on mental models. I created the diagrams and animations that help communicate the core concepts. We created it with the support of the egghead team who took care of logistics like email promotion, web infrastructure, and customer support.

I've become enamoured with [Visual Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language) and [End-user Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_development) over the last 6 months. The [Future of Coding](https://futureofcoding.org/) community and [Gordon Brandon](https://subconscious.substack.com/)'s newsletter have been particularly valuable hubs of insight.

Chatted to a few podcast folks;

1. Adam Wiggins and Mark McGranaghan on [Metamuse](https://museapp.com/podcast/) about visual programming.
2. Scott Francis and Evan Payne on [Frontend Heroes](https://frontendheroes.transistor.fm/) about a little bit of everything

Currently preparing a talk for two conferences in October; [React Live Conference](https://reactlive.nl/) in Amsterdam and [React Advanced](https://reactadvanced.com/) here in London. On various ways to visualise React, why visual representations work so well, the pros / cons / wicked historical problems of adding graphical and spatial affordances to programming interfaces, and why we should keep trying despite the challenges.

### September 2020

Digging into the work of [Barbara Tversky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Tversky) and reading the literature around [embodied cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition). I've been a long time fan of [George Lakoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff) so much of it us familiar. Tverksy's new book [Mind in Motion](/mind-in-motion) builds off many of the same themes.

Delaying a part-time Masters degree in [Digital Anthropology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/study/graduate-taught/digital-anthropology-msc) at UCL until next year when we'll hopefully be less Covid-y

Reading [Working in Public](/working-in-public) by Nadia Eghbal

Exploring the connections between technology and magic through the writings of [Alfred Gell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Gell). Specifically enjoyed the paper [The Technology of Enchantment and the Enchantment of Technology](http://www.xenopraxis.net/readings/gell_technologyenchantment.pdf)

Playing [Thing From the Future](http://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/) – A game that challenges players to collaboratively and competitively describe objects from a range of alternative futures.
