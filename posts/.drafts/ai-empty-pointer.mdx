Most people who work in the field of “Artificial Intelligence” rarely use the term. In fact, refering to something as “AI” is a flag you probably don't know much about the industry.

People in the field instead talk about specific technologies and techniques: machine learning, neural networks, natural language processing, latent space diffusers, and GANs.

AI becames a catchall term for this wide array of disciplines that sometimes have very little in common. A bit like how “cancer” is the catch-all diagnosis for XXX widly divergent diseases.

A lot of this is just moving goal posts. “AI” is whatever we consider just beyond the grasp of our understanding in computer science.

A TI-39 claculator is artificial intellgience. When Google first came out it was artificial intellgince. Now it's just what we expect

Many people have pointed to this lack of meaning behind the moniker.I've taken to collecting definitions from various leaders in the field. Or rather, thoughts on the lack of definition. Stewart Russell says XXX
Lucy Suchman calls it XXX
Genevieve Bell calls it XXX

Turns out penty of industries have this. Robotics can't agree on what defines a robot. Is a toaster a robot?
