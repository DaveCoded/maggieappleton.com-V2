<IntroParagraph>

Over the last five years, our digital documents and pages have taken on a strange shape. They have become noticeably _blocky_.

</IntroParagraph>

The **block** – a rectangular section of your document that looks and acts a certain way, depending on its type – is our new hot interface pattern<Footnote idName={1}>Take "new" lightly here. The concept of blocks is an exceptionally old idea in software design, but we will cover that ground later.</Footnote>. The way swipeable cards were all the rage in 2014.

You have almost certainly seen and used these blocks. They come in an array of familiar types; ranging from simple formats like headers and blockquotes, to complex interactive widgets like tables and embeds.

These blocks don't look terribly different to what you see on the web every day. Except normal, everyday users can **create**, **edit**, and **publish** them on the web without touching any HTML, CSS, or JS. <Footnote idName={2}>At a lower level these blocks are of course built with core web technologies, but at the level of the user interface people don't need to touch code.</Footnote>

They tend to show up in two environments: tools for authoring documents, including wikis and note-taking applications. And "no-code" website builders that give you a graphical user interface to create webpages. We've christened these user-friendly, syntax-free environments _block-based editors_.

We're in the middle of a Cambrian explosion of these editors on the web. Almost every document editor and no-code website builder uses the concept of blocks in their interface; Notion, Wordpress Gutenberg, Google Docs, Squarespace, Coda, Craft, Clover, Roam Research, Almanac, Logseq, Remnote, Observable, the list goes on.

At last count I found 23 block-editors in active development, and I've certainly missed some. Two more will get seed funding while you're reading this.

Given this popular burst, it's a fine time to ask some clarifying questions:

- What _exactly_ is a "block"?
- Why are blocks such a popular and widely used interface pattern?
- What common standards and best practices are we congregating around for how blocks work?
- What historical threads led us to block-based interfaces?
- What new possibilities do blocks enable for both developers and end-users?

Here's the plan; we'll start with a quick tour through the popular interface patterns being used in these editors. We'll then consider what block-based editors allow us to do that classical text-centric editors can't. We'll explore what historical interface traditions and infrastructure made our block-filled present possible. And then finally chuck around some irresponsibly speculative ideas on how the block landscape might evolve in the coming years.

## The Conventional Patterns of Block-Editors

Despite serving a wide range of audiences and use cases, block-editors have converged on an impressively consistent set of interface patterns.

Documents made with block-editors look suspiciously similar to traditional documents, but are built around a different conceptual model. Rather than treating documents as strings and paragraphs of styled text, these editors treat them as a stack of types blocks:

<FullWidthSection width="1100px">

<TextvBlocks />

</FullWidthSection>

It's a mindset shift from a text-first environment to a block-first environment. We used to add special objects like images and tables to documents where text was the default format. In block-editors, text isn't treated any differently to the image or table – it's just another block.

Most block-editors still begin with text input though. To add a block you type the slash `/` key <Footnote idName={3}>Or rarely `@` if an app is feeling particularly spicy and innovative</Footnote> or click a floating + icon nearby, and a selection menu appears with a set of block choices:

You pick a block and it renders in place – usually presenting a few input fields and prompts for the kind of content it accepts. Each block type has its own formatting conventions and unique affordances.

Checklist blocks let you mark items as done, assign people to tasks, and add due dates.

There is no univerally agreed-upon list of block types, but these editors all have a common set of basics: text, header, image, checklist, bullet list, numbered list, callout, table, blockquote, embed, code block, divider, video, and file.

Beyond that, it's open season. Blocks come in a wide range of formats, from simple presentational formatting to wildly complex; enough to be a standalone app in its own right.

Every block editor adds on a range of extended functionality.

Some editors include more advanced blocks – Google Maps, Figma designs, image galleries, live coding environments, fully decked-out spreadsheets that function as relational databases. These become competitive advantages in an increasingly monoblock landscape.

Hardcore editors hook their blocks up to robust data structures on the backend, making it possible to relate blocks to one another through connections, referencing, and programmatic logic.

For example, Roam allows you to embed blocks inside one another and see the backlinks between them. Coda takes this a step further and turns blocks into a simple interface for a full programmatic environment.

### Swapping and Moving Blocks

If you decide you want a different block, you can easily swap it out. The content adapts to fit its new format. Data and display aren't tied to one another in block land. You can flexibly play with multiple ways to show the same data.

Checklists can become blockquotes. Headers can become collapsible toggles. Tables can become kanban boards. <Footnote idName={4}>There are of course sensible limitations to this. Most applications won't let you turn an image into a code block or a video block.</Footnote>

{visual for swapping blocks}

Blocks are easy to copy, paste, and duplicate. Using direct manipulation you can drag and drop them into new positions, making it quick to restructure a document without faffing about with precise text selection.

There's a core set of block types that most of these editors provide:

Like all good software designers, the people creating these new editors are following [Jakob's Law](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/jakobs-law-internet-ux/) of internet user experience; people spend 99% of their time on websites _other than yours_. You'll make their lives far easier if you use design patterns they're already familiar with. While many will grumble the similarities between block-editors speaks to a lack of "innovation," <Footnote idName={3}> "Innovate" | ˈɪnəveɪt | verb. To flagrantly disregard previous historical work and established conventions that have survived the test of time. Results may vary. </Footnote> the industry converging around a set of standards is a net gain for both users and creators.

## What _exactly_ is a block?

We've now seen the general shape and interface patterns of blocks, but what _precisely_ defines a block?

We all love a good definitional debate, and I am not one to rob us of this opportunity. I offered a concise definition above: "A block is a rectangular section of your document that looks and acts a certain way, depending on its type."

I think it's pretty good summary of the situation, but one that leaks in a hundred ways. According to this, the navigation bar, sidebar submenu, and obnoxious chat widget that won't stop audibly alerting you to a message from a bot could all be mistaken for blocks.

Let's try again, wearing our technological pedant hat: <Footnote idName={5}>This is a good faith best effort, which I'm certainly open to revising if and when more intelligent and experienced people point out its flaws on Twitter. At least be polite when you do :)</Footnote>

<SimpleCard>

A block is the basic semantic unit of a block-based document. Each block has a unique type that determines what kind of data the block will accept, and how it will visually present that data. Blocks also encapsulate a set of functionality that define how it will create and modify the data within it.

</SimpleCard>

#### What Blocks are Not

To reduce any confusion, let's also make clear what blocks are _not_. Within the context of this essay, blocks do not refer to:

- An entry on a blockchain ledger, or anything to do with Web3 blockchain hype. Please take that party elsewhere.
- A specific technical implementation; they are not the same as React components, Web Components, or software components. They are a conceptual idea about how we present editable content to end-users of the web.

{cartoon sketch of a block as a higher interface concept, possibly implemented in WC/React/etc, but not concerned with implementation. And nothing to do with the blockchain}

The blocks I am talking about here are a pure interface pattern. How that pattern is implemented is beyond the scope of this article and my limited knowledge as a pseudo-engineer. I'm interested in blocks from a user and interface designer perspective. <Footnote idName={6}>There is plenty to be said about the technical challenges of how we could/should build interoperable blocks built on solid web standards, but I'll leave that to someone else. Perhaps you?</Footnote>

## What Blocks Give Us

As with every shiny new interface pattern, we should sit down seriously consider whether blocks are truly improving our computational lives. What have block-based editors allowed us to do that we weren't able to do before?

### Evolving from Text to Blocks

How are block-based editors different to the document editors we've had so far?

Before these atomic, interactive blocks started appearing, our documents were predominately made up of simple text. A linear string of characters, spaces, and new lines breaks were the basic units of any digital document.

<FullWidthSection width="1000px">

<LinearChars />

</FullWidthSection>

String enough of these lines together and you have a document.

Simple text didn't stay simple for long. Starting in the 1980's, we added on _rich text editing_ – text marked up with formatting like **bold**, _italics_, ~~strikethroughs~~, <u>underlines</u>, <mark>highlights</mark> and the like. Souped up text editors dave us even more formatting options like making the <br /><span style={{ fontSize: "2rem" }}>font size huge <span style={{ color: "#DB552C" }}>and orange</span></span> <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1643619446/maggieappleton.com/essays/block-editors/wordart_1_qtghbu.png" alt="The words 'and 3D' styled in a giant, orange 3D text effect" style={{ display: "inline-block", margin: "0", width: "220px", position: "relative", top: "30px", marginTop: "-25px" }} />

<Spacer size="small" />

These presentational annotations certainly add semantic meaning – big, orange, 3D text is clearly important.

But the formatting options available to us in classic rich text editing only manipulate the visual style of a set of characters. They rarely add meaningful semantic or functional structure to the document that the computer can understand.

Blocks, on the other hand, combine visual formatting with semantic structure. A Header block is significant both visually and as a type the computer understands.

### Block-based and Block-accepting Editors

Most modern document editors are now block-based. Or more accurately, block-accepting.

Some have only one foot in blockland; their interface presents as a traditional text-editor, but you can add blocks as special objects. These are a kind of hybrid block-editor. Lines of text are still the primary medium, while blocks feel like fancy visitors.

True block-editors treat blocks as first-class citizens – they make clear every object the user creates is a block, including text blocks such as paragraphs and headers that would otherwise be considered regular inline text.

<img width="" src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300" alt="" />

{diagram of a traditional text-editor with text as a first-class citizen and inline blocks as fancy add-ons vs. visual of a full block document}

### What do blocks give us that linear text can't?

On the surface level, a page of linear text and a page of blocks seem identical. But _structurally_ and _functionally_ they are entirely different beasts.

{description of how block-based documents are different to rich text editors}

- Stylistic edits vs structural edits
- Granular character level editing vs block-level editing
- Documents as basic unit of linking, reference, and comments vs block as basic unit
- Flexibility of drag and drop rearrangement; importance of rapid rearrangement
- Swapping block types without changing the content; able to easily view the same data multiple ways
- Interactive and reactive documents; dynamic data on a page you can see in multiple ways, transform, and edit.

All of these presentational annotations expand what we're able to express and communicate through the medium of digital documents. But they're mostly surface level. Stylistic annotations change the visual display of our information, without applying any structural changes to the data. When we make text big and orange, the programme does not encode that as "this text is important" or "this text is a headline." It has no semantic structure.

Formatting at the character level gives us an enormous amount of granular control – enough to hang ourselves with.

Classical documents might format at the character level, but they organise at the document level. The document is the entity you reference when you link to your work or reference it by name.

A block can be dragged and dropped into a new position on the page. It can be swapped for another type of block without changing its content. It can be copied and pasted into a different document without losing its content and structure.

<img width="" src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300" alt="" />

{annotated diagram of swapping blocks and dragging and dropping blocks}

Blocks open up a world of flexibility and interactive power within a scoped area. They're easier to move around – a key quality for anyone working with ideas who needs to arrange and rearrange information in relationships to find the right groupings and sequences – which is to say, all of us doing knowledge work.

### Blocks as end-user programming for the web

It is unsurprising the standard list of block types maps fairly tightly to the [basic text tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#text_content) in HTML; `<h1>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<blockquote>`, etc. The web was originally designed as a medium to author and share academic documents, and these basic primitives are still serving us well.

We might be tempted to think blocks are just a way to reuse pre-made snippets of HTML with a GUI stuck on top. This could be true for very basic blocks that simply format text. But many blocks offered by these editors included advanced functionality like uploading files, running calculations, external data integrations, state management, dynamic views, and the ability to filter, sort, and search for data.

We're so used to having access to this type of advanced formatting and functionality on the web we barely think twice about it.

But before these block-editors showed up you would need to know a non-trivial amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if you wanted to add something this complex to a document on the web.

Figuring out how to stick some text in a `<p>` tag is one thing, but building a dynamic table with sorting and filtering is way beyond the programming capabilities of most of us. Blocks provide a user-friendly interface for creating rich, complex web components that previously only developers has access to. They shift power – even if only slightly – from developers to end users.

Even document editors that aren't _officially_ webpage creators end up inadvertendly playing the role. Notion is designed as a wiki for teams, but so many people have reappropriated it as a platform for building personal websites, whole side industries have emerged to support it.

## A History of Blocks

If I asked you to guess when blocks and block-based editors first appeared, I'd expect the audience to split into two camps with very different time scales:

<Blocktimeline />

To prove this point, I ran a quick Twitter poll to gauge the level of historical awareness around block-editors within a small audience of fairly well-informed programmers and interface nerds <Footnote idName={3}>I don't have hard stats on the demographics of my twitter followers, I'd summarise the group as tools for thought enthusiasts, interface designers, and web developers</Footnote>:

<TweetEmbed tweetId="1486694395583901709" />

Let's first acknowledge my poll is fundamentally flawed given that it offers my predicted answers by default, and requires people go to the effort of replying if they have an alternate view.

Reply answers included [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard), Douglas Engelbart's [NLS System](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system)>), [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson), and the [Pygmalion](http://acypher.com/wwid/Chapters/01Pygmalion.html) visual programming language.

The question itself was also duplicitous. Trying to pin-point a single "invention moment" by one person or project in history is a fool's errand. Especially in the field of interface design where every new creation is a bric-a-brac recompilation of existing conventions and standards.

But we all make compromises to run reductive, ad-hoc twitter polls.

I wasn't surprised to find most people attribute the interface pattern to Notion. Notion was certainly not the first or last block editor, but it's easily the most visible and widely used to date. It predecessors are not immediately obvious, and do a poor job of self-promotion. This is compounded by the fact the web development and design industry is reasonably oblivious to historical precedent. This isn't out of laziness or ambivalence. Access to holistic histories of programming, interface design, and HCI is poor and much of this knowledge is held within elite institutions and academic journals.

I'd heartily agree all of these people and projects contributed significant ideas that moved us closer to blocks and block-based editors. Many of them described or implemented software patterns that could easily be interpreted as block-like.

To make sense of this historical trajectory, I've split the evolution of blocks into three distinct ages:

{graphic of the three ages on a timeline}

1. The first age – 1965-1975
2. The second age – 1994-1997
3. The third age – 2018-present

Each of these time frames saw a surge in projects that explored the qualities that led block-based interfaces and work that addressed pragmatic issues like UX usability and hardware capacity.

### The First Age of Blocks – Xanadu, NLS, and Hypercard

<h5 style={{ marginTop: "-0.6rem" }}>1965-1975</h5>

I would consider projects like Xanadu, Engelbert's NLS, and Hypercard spiritual predecesors in this story. The interfaces patterns they established moved us closer to thinking in blocks.

Like countless other concepts we rely upon in modern computing, Ted Nelson is behind this one. In 1965 his Computer Lib / Dream Machines book outlined "-----"

A working prototype is worth a million words.

### The Second Age of Blocks – Microsoft OLE and Open Doc

<h5 style={{ marginTop: "-0.6rem" }}>1994-1997</h5>

The idea of creating stacks of uniquely typed blocks inside documents first emerged in the early 1990's.

Microsoft developed a system that allowed users to select an "object" created in one Microsoft application and embed it in another. This **Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)** technology meant you could select a set of cells in Microsoft Excel, copy it, and then paste it into a Microsoft Word document. 'Embedding' the Excel object into Word.

{OLE diagram}

In the parlance of the time, these were called "compound documents"

Microsoft's OLE was the first implementation that made block-based documents possible. Despite this big pragmatic leap, they let their imaginations stop short. OLE didn't seem to spur any dreams beyond copying and pasting bits of Microsoft applications into one another.

Apple stepped up with a vision that aimed to compete with OLE, but took the idea to its full potential. OpenDoc was a programme that flipped the concept of how applications worked on its head. It proposed a compound document made up of multiple small applications, things it called "parts" – similar to our modern day blocks, but more ambitious.

{OpenDoc diagram}

If we're just going off the promotional videos, OpenDoc is the clear winner in this popularity contest:

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFJdjk2rq4E" />

There's still a strong contingent of OpenDoc enthusiasts around. Lamenting its death, analysing what went wrong, and waiting for the idea to re-emerge.

<TweetEmbed tweetId="1389236351711731712" />

### The Third Age of Blocks – Gutenberg, Notion, and the Cambrian Explosion

<h5 style={{ marginTop: "-0.6rem" }}>2014-present</h5>

Starting in 2014 we entered the third age of the block.

In this context, despite being the most visible and widely used block-editor to date, Notion was quite late to the game.
It's undeniable Notion has been the most influential platform championing and pushing the boundaries of block-based editing in recent years.

But Notion certainly didn't come up with blocks.

It is exceptionally ironic that when Micrososoft announced their new project "Microsoft Loop" in X, it was lambasted across Twitter as a "shameless Notion clone."

These editors are sometimes belittled as "Notion clones", although Notion was not the first or last platform to implement the conceptual model of documents composed of blocks. Nevertheless, it became a touchstone reference point – a software category in its own right. Like _Uber for X_, we now have _Notion, but with Y feature_.

## Blocks of the Future

The web was born as a text-first medium. Tim Berners Lee designed it to mimic text documents. Specifically, long, linear research documents shared among scientists and academics as pieces of paper. Ever since then we've been negotiating its paper-like qualities.

The text-first, document-based model comes with a lot of design implications. It presumes the document or page is the basic unit of the web. We store our metadata at the level of the page, usually in the `<head>` tag. We link at the page level, rather than at the word, paragraph, or section level. <Footnote idName={1}>This has improved slightly with #header-level links, but the vast majority of links are still to entire pages, not granular lines or sections within a page.</Footnote>
