<IntroParagraph>

Over the last five years, our digital documents and pages have taken on a strange shape. They have become distinctly _blocky_.

</IntroParagraph>

The **block** – a rectangular section of your document that looks and acts a certain way, depending on its type – is our new hot interface pattern<Footnote idName={1}>Take "new" lightly here. The concept of blocks is an exceptionally old idea in software design, but we will cover that ground later.</Footnote>. The way swipeable cards were all the rage in 2014.

You have almost certainly seen and used these blocks. They come in an array of familiar types, ranging from simple visual formats like:

{header}

{paragraph}

{callout box}

{Image}

To complex, interactive data views like

{Table}

{Kanban}

{embed}

Before these blocks started appearing, our documents were primarily a rich text affair. You could add markup to text to create headings, bolded, italics, and underlined text. But we never moved far beyond this limited range of formats.

We understood our documents as strings of characters separated by spaces and line breaks. The whole document was one entity that you manipulated on a character-by-character basis.

This mental model of what a document is, how it's structured, and how you go about manipulating its contents is slowly evolving.

What used to be a string of styled text has now become a set of blocks within a page. We are shifting from a conceptual model where a document is a stack of typed blocks:

<FullWidthSection width="1100px">

<TextvBlocks />

</FullWidthSection>

On the surface level, these two pages seem identical. But _structurally_ and _functionally_ they're entirely different beasts.

A block can be dragged and dropped into a new position on the page. It can be swapped for another type of block without changing its content. It can be copied and pasted into a different document without losing its content and structure.

Blocks open up a world of flexibilty and interactive power within a scoped area. They're easier to move around – a key quality for anyone working with ideas who needs to arrange and rearrange information in relationships to find the rgith groupings and sequences – which is to say, all of us doing knowledge work.

### Block-based and Block-accepting Editors

The places where we create these blocks have been christened _block-based editors_. Most modern document editors are now block-based. Or more accurately, block-accepting.

Some have only one foot in blockland; their interface presents as a traditional text-editor, but you can add blocks as special objects. These are a kind of hybrid block-editor. Lines of text are still the primary medium, while blocks feel like fancy visitors.

True block-editors treat blocks as first-class citizens – they make clear every object the user creates is a block, including text blocks such as paragraphs and headers that would otherwise be considered regular inline text.

The interface pattern for how these editors work has become impressive consistent. You begin in a document, type the key `/` <Footnote idName={2}>Or rarely `@` if an app is feeling particularly spicy and innovative</Footnote> or click a floating + icon nearby, and a selection menu appears with a set of block choices:

<SimpleCard>Paragraph, Header, Table, Image, Checklist.</SimpleCard>

Some editors include more advanced blocks – Google Maps, Figma designs, image galleries, live coding environments, fully decked-out spreadsheets that function as relational databases. These become competitive advantages in an increasingly monoblock landscape.

### It's raining block-editors

Everywhere you look, another block editor springs up out of the web.
These systems are sometimes belitted as _Notion clones_, although Notion was not the first or last platform to implement the conceptual model of documents composed of blocks. Nevertheless, it has become the touchstone reference point – a software category in its own right. Like _Uber for X_, we now have _Notion, but with Y feature_

As of early 2022 here's a brief list of all the block-based editors on the market.

By lumping these under apps one categorical title, I don't mean to diminish their distinct strengths and features. Every startup is a unique and special snowflake.

Hardcore editors hook their blocks up to robust data structures on the backend, making it possible to relate blocks to one another through connections, referencing, and programmatic logic.

For example, Roam allows you to embed blocks inside one another and see the backlinks between them. Coda takes this a step further and turns blocks into a simple interface for a full programmatic environment.

## What _exactly_ is a block?

We all love a good definitional debate, and I am not one to rob us of this opportunity. I offered a concise definition above: "A block is a rectangular section of your document that looks and acts a certain way, depending on its type."

I think it's pretty good summary of the situation, but one that leaks in a hundred ways. According to this, the website navigation bar, the sidebar submenu, and the obnoxious customer support chat widget that won't stop audibly alerting you to a message from a bot, could all be mistaken for blocks.

Let's try again, wearing our pedantic engineering hat;

<SimpleCard>

A block is the basic semantic unit of a block-based document. Each block has a unique type that determines what kind of data the block will accept, and how it will visually present that data. Blocks also encapsulate a set of functionality that define how it will create and modify the data within it.

## Blocks in historical context

If I asked you to guess who came up with blocks and block-based editors, I'd expect the audience to split into two camps with very different time scales:

"Notion invented it"
"Ted Nelson / OpenDoc / Microsoft OLE invented it"

{ could you make this a "pick one of these choices" game? }

It's undeniable Notion has been the most influential platform championing and pushing the boundaries of block-based editing in recent years.

But Notion certainly didn't come up with blocks.

Like countless other concepts we rely upon in modern computing, Ted Nelson is behind this one. In 1965 his Computer Lib / Dream Machines book outlined "-----"

A working prototype is worth a million words.

## Blocking out the web

The web was born as a text-first medium. Tim Berners Lee designed it to mimic text documents. Specifically, long, linear research documents shared among scientists and academics as pieces of paper. Ever since then we've been negotiating its paper-like qualities.

The text-first, document-based model comes with a lot of design implications. It presumes the document or page is the basic unit of the web. We store our metadata at the level of the page, usually in the `<head>` tag. We link at the page level, rather than at the word, paragraph, or section level. <Footnote idName={1}>This has improved slightly with #header-level links, but the vast majority of links are still to entire pages, not granular lines or sections within a page.</Footnote>
