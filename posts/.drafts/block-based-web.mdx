<IntroParagraph>

The web was born as a text-first medium. Tim Berners Lee designed it to mimic text documents. Specifically, long, linear research documents shared among scientists and academics as pieces of paper. Ever since then we've been negotiating its paper-like qualities.

</IntroParagraph>

The text-first, document-based model comes with a lot of design implications. It presumes the document or page is the basic meaningful unit of the web. We store our metadata at the level of the page, usually in the `<head>` tag. We link at the page level, rather than at the word, paragraph, or section level. <Footnote idName={1}>This has improved slightly with #header-level links, but the vast majority of links are still to entire pages, not granular lines or sections within a page.</Footnote>
