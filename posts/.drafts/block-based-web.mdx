<IntroParagraph>

Over the last five years, our digital documents and pages have taken on a strange shape. They have become noticeably _blocky_.

</IntroParagraph>

The **block** – a rectangular section of your document that looks and acts a certain way, depending on its type – is our new hot interface pattern<Footnote idName={1}>Take "new" lightly here. The concept of blocks is an exceptionally old idea in software design, but we will cover that ground later.</Footnote>. The way swipeable cards were all the rage in 2014.

You have almost certainly seen and used these blocks. They come in an array of familiar types; ranging from simple formats like headers and blockquotes, to complex interactive widgets like tables and embeds.

These blocks don't look drastically different to what you see on the web every day. Except normal, everyday users can **create**, **edit**, and **publish** them to the web without touching any HTML, CSS, or JS. <Footnote idName={2}>At a lower level these blocks are of course built with core web technologies, but at the level of the user interface people don't need to touch code.</Footnote> They are a syntax-free, user-friendly way to create dynamic, complex documents and pages on the web.

The places where we create these blocks have been christened _block-based editors_. And they fall into two major categories; apps for authoring documents, including collaborative wikis and note-taking applications. And "no-code" website builders that help people create blog posts and simple websites.

{graphic of blocks inside a document and a no code builder}

We're now in the middle of a Cambrian explosion of these editors. Almost every document editor and no-code website builder is based around the concept of blocks; [Notion](), [Wordpress Gutenberg](), [Google Docs](), [Squarespace](), [Coda](), [ClickUp](), [Craft](), [Clover](), [Roam Research](), [Almanac](), [Logseq](), [Remnote](), [Clarity](), the list goes on.

At last count I found 23 block-editors in active development, and I've certainly missed some. Two more will get seed funding while you're reading this.

Given this popular burst, it's a fine time to ask some clarifying questions:

- What _exactly_ is a "block"?
- Why are blocks such a popular and widely used interface pattern?
- What common standards and best practices are we congregating around for how blocks work?
- What historical threads led us to block-based interfaces?
- What new possibilities do blocks enable for both developers and end-users?

Here's the plan; we'll start with a quick tour through the popular interface patterns being used in these editors. We'll then consider what block-based editors allow us to do that classical text-centric editors can't. We'll explore what historical interface traditions and infrastructure made our block-filled present possible. And then finally chuck around some irresponsibly speculative ideas on how the block landscape might evolve in the coming years.

## The Conventional Patterns of Block-Editors

At the moment we don't have a strict definition of what counts as a _block-based editor_, but our current ones all follow an impressively consistent set of interface patterns:

1. **Blocks are first-class citizens**  
   Documents made with blocks look suspiciously similar to traditional documents, but are built around a different conceptual model. Rather than treating documents as strings and paragraphs of styled text, these editors treat them as a stack of types blocks:

<FullWidthSection width="1100px">

<TextvBlocks />

</FullWidthSection>

It's a mindset shift from a text-first environment to a block-first environment.
In classic documents where text is the default format, you can sometimes add special elements like images or tables, but they're treated as exceptions. In block-editors, text isn't treated any differently to the image or table – it's just another block. Blocks are the primary unit, not lines of text.

2. **Quick selection menus to create blocks**  
   All block-based editors allow you to quickly add a block to a document by typing a hotkey – usually the slash `/` key <Footnote idName={3}>Or rarely `@` if an app is feeling particularly spicy and innovative. Sometimes you can also click a floating + icon nearby.</Footnote>. This triggers a selection menu with a set of block choices:

You pick a block type and it appears inline. You can then add content to the block, or continue adding blocks below.

3. **Blocks come in a set of unique, pre-formatted types**  
   Each block type has its own formatting conventions and unique affordances.
   When you create a new block it presents a few input fields and prompts for the kind of content it accepts.

Checklist blocks let you type in text, tap the checkbox to items as done, assign people to tasks, and add due dates.

Image blocks let you upload files, embed images via URL, or search through popular creative commons libraries like Unsplash.

Table blocks let you arrange data in spreadsheets where you can name columns, add extra rows, and sort and filter values.

There is no univerally agreed-upon list of block types, but these editors all have a common set of basics: text, header, image, checklist, bullet list, numbered list, callout, table, blockquote, embed, code block, divider, video, and file.

Beyond that, it's open season. Blocks come in a wide range of formats, from simple presentational formatting to wildly complex; enough to be a standalone app in its own right.

Every block editor adds on a range of extended functionality.

Some editors include more advanced blocks – Google Maps, Figma designs, image galleries, live coding environments, fully decked-out spreadsheets that function as relational databases. These become competitive advantages in an increasingly monoblock landscape.

{spectrum of simple to complex blocks}

4.**Blocks are directly manipulatable**  
 If you want to change a block, you click just to the left, or you click directly on it to drag and drop it into a new position. You are directly touching the thing you want to change, rather than typing instructions decribing the thing you want to change into a command line.
Blocks are easy to copy, paste, and duplicate. Using direct manipulation you can drag and drop them into new positions, making it quick to restructure a document without faffing about with precise text selection.

{visual for drag and drop}

5. **Content and display formatting are separated; blocks are interchangeable**  
   The content a block holds and the way it displays that data isn't firmly tied together.

{diagram of content and view being separated}

If you decide you want a different block, you can easily swap it out. The content adapts to fit its new format. Data and display aren't tied to one another in block land. You can flexibly play with multiple ways to show the same data.

Checklists can become blockquotes. Headers can become collapsible toggles. Tables can become kanban boards. <Footnote idName={4}>There are of course sensible limitations to this. Most applications won't let you turn an image into a code block or a video block.</Footnote>

{visual for swapping blocks}

6.  **Data can be shared between blocks**  
    The content we put into a block isn't necessarily constrained to that block. In most of the more advanced block-editors, blocks can reference data held inside other blocks.

Blocks are an interface element that allows users to input complex data. They would be fairly limited if that data was contained to a single block.

One of the features that makes our current block-based editors exceptionally powerful is being able to query and reference data held in other blocks.

Notion's "database"-type blocks are one of its most popular features.

Coda is pushing hard in the direction of complex, programmatic systems presented in blocks

Hardcore editors hook their blocks up to robust data structures on the backend, making it possible to relate blocks to one another through connections, referencing, and programmatic logic.

For example, Roam allows you to embed blocks inside one another and see the backlinks between them. Coda takes this a step further and turns blocks into a simple interface for a full programmatic environment.

---

Like all good software designers, the people creating these new editors are following [Jakob's Law](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/jakobs-law-internet-ux/) of internet user experience; people spend 99% of their time on websites _other than yours_. You'll make their lives far easier if you use design patterns they're already familiar with. While many will grumble the similarities between block-editors speaks to a lack of "innovation," <Footnote idName={3}> "Innovate" | ˈɪnəveɪt | verb. To flagrantly disregard previous historical work and established conventions that have survived the test of time. Results may vary. </Footnote> the industry converging around a set of standards is a net gain for both users and creators.

## What _exactly_ is a block?

We've now seen the general shape and interface patterns of blocks, but what _precisely_ defines a block?

We all love a good definitional debate, and I am not one to rob us of this opportunity. I offered a concise definition above: "A block is a rectangular section of your document that looks and acts a certain way, depending on its type."

I think it's pretty good summary of the situation, but one that leaks in a hundred ways. According to this, the navigation bar, the block-selector dropdown menu, and obnoxious chat widget that won't stop audibly alerting you to a message from a bot could all be mistaken for blocks.

Let's try again, wearing our technological pedant hat: <Footnote idName={5}>This is a good faith best effort, which I'm certainly open to revising if and when more intelligent and experienced people point out its flaws on Twitter. At least be polite when you do :)</Footnote>

<SimpleCard>

A block is the basic semantic unit of a block-based interface. It is one of many blocks that can be flexibly arranged and interlinked within a document or canvas.
Each block is:

- connected to a specific set of data
- has a unique type that determines how it displays that data
- includes a set of interactive controls that allow users to edit and manipulate that data

</SimpleCard>

Blocks can also contain other blocks

#### What Blocks are Not

To reduce any confusion, let's also make clear what blocks are _not_. Within the context of this essay, blocks do not refer to:

- An entry on a blockchain ledger, or anything to do with Web3 blockchain hype. Please take that party elsewhere.
- A specific technical implementation; they are not the same as React components, Web Components, or software components. They are a conceptual idea about how we present editable content to end-users of the web.

{cartoon sketch of a block as a higher interface concept, possibly implemented in WC/React/etc, but not concerned with implementation. And nothing to do with the blockchain}

The blocks I am talking about here are an interface pattern. How that pattern is implemented is beyond the scope of this article and my limited knowledge as a pseudo-engineer. I'm interested in blocks from a user and interface designer perspective, rather than a web infrastructure perspective. <Footnote idName={6}>There is plenty to be said about the technical challenges of how we could/should build interoperable blocks built on solid web standards, but I'll leave that to someone else. Perhaps you?</Footnote>

## What Blocks Give Us

As with every shiny new interface pattern, we should question it. Even if the benefits of blocks seem obvious on the surface, it's worth asking what ways of working blocks have made possible. And what ways of working they've made harder or entirely impossible.

Block-based editors have changed the way we do two major types of work:

- Creating simple website and blog posts
- Creating documents in wikis and note-taking apps

Let's look at each of these in turn.

### Blogging Before Blocks

Before they came along, creating a website or blog post of _the same level of complexity_ avaliable in block editors would have required writing HTML, CSS, and JS by hand.

### Blocks as end-user programming for the web

It is unsurprising the standard list of block types maps fairly tightly to the [basic text tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#text_content) in HTML; `<h1>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<blockquote>`, etc. The web was originally designed as a medium to author and share academic documents, and these basic primitives are still serving us well.

We might be tempted to think blocks are just a way to reuse pre-made snippets of HTML with a GUI stuck on top. This could be true for very basic blocks that simply format text. But many blocks offered by these editors included advanced functionality like uploading files, running calculations, external data integrations, state management, dynamic views, and the ability to filter, sort, and search for data.

We're so used to having access to this type of advanced formatting and functionality on the web we barely think twice about it.

But before these block-editors showed up you would need to know a non-trivial amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript if you wanted to add something this complex to a document on the web.

Figuring out how to stick some text in a `<p>` tag is one thing, but building a dynamic table with sorting and filtering is way beyond the programming capabilities of most of us. Blocks provide a user-friendly interface for creating rich, complex web components that previously only developers has access to. They shift power – even if only slightly – from developers to end users.

Even document editors that aren't _officially_ webpage creators end up inadvertendly playing the role. Notion is designed as a wiki for teams, but so many people have reappropriated it as a platform for building personal websites, whole side industries have emerged to support it.

### Documents Before Blocks

Before these atomic, interactive blocks started appearing, our documents were predominately made up of simple text. A linear string of characters, spaces, and new lines breaks were the basic units of any digital document.

<FullWidthSection width="1000px">

<LinearChars />

</FullWidthSection>

String enough of these lines together and you have a document.

Simple text didn't stay simple for long. Starting in the 1980's, we added on _rich text editing_ – text marked up with formatting like **bold**, _italics_, ~~strikethroughs~~, <u>underlines</u>, <mark>highlights</mark> and the like. Souped up text editors dave us even more formatting options like making the <br /><span style={{ fontSize: "2rem" }}>font size huge <span style={{ color: "#DB552C" }}>and orange</span></span> <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1643619446/maggieappleton.com/essays/block-editors/wordart_1_qtghbu.png" alt="The words 'and 3D' styled in a giant, orange 3D text effect" style={{ display: "inline-block", margin: "0", width: "220px", position: "relative", top: "30px", marginTop: "-25px" }} />

<Spacer size="small" />

These presentational annotations certainly add semantic meaning – big, orange, 3D text is clearly important.

But the formatting options available to us in classic rich text editing only manipulate the visual style of a set of characters. They rarely add meaningful semantic or functional structure to the document that the computer can understand.

Blocks, on the other hand, combine visual formatting with semantic structure. A Header block is significant both visually and as a type the computer understands.

In the case of documents in wikis and notes, we simply couldn't have created docs as complex with our previous tools.

### Block-based and Block-accepting Editors

Most modern document editors are now block-based. Or more accurately, block-accepting.

Some have only one foot in blockland; their interface presents as a traditional text-editor, but you can add blocks as special objects. These are a kind of hybrid block-editor. Lines of text are still the primary medium, while blocks feel like fancy visitors.

True block-editors treat blocks as first-class citizens – they make clear every object the user creates is a block, including text blocks such as paragraphs and headers that would otherwise be considered regular inline text.

<img width="" src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300" alt="" />

{diagram of a traditional text-editor with text as a first-class citizen and inline blocks as fancy add-ons vs. visual of a full block document}

### What do blocks give us that linear text can't?

On the surface level, a page of linear text and a page of blocks seem identical. But _structurally_ and _functionally_ they are entirely different beasts.

{description of how block-based documents are different to rich text editors}

- Stylistic edits vs structural edits
- Granular character level editing vs block-level editing
- Documents as basic unit of linking, reference, and comments vs block as basic unit
- Flexibility of drag and drop rearrangement; importance of rapid rearrangement
- Swapping block types without changing the content; able to easily view the same data multiple ways
- Interactive and reactive documents; dynamic data on a page you can see in multiple ways, transform, and edit.

All of these presentational annotations expand what we're able to express and communicate through the medium of digital documents. But they're mostly surface level. Stylistic annotations change the visual display of our information, without applying any structural changes to the data. When we make text big and orange, the programme does not encode that as "this text is important" or "this text is a headline." It has no semantic structure.

Formatting at the character level gives us an enormous amount of granular control – enough to hang ourselves with.

Classical documents might format at the character level, but they organise at the document level. The document is the entity you reference when you link to your work or reference it by name.

A block can be dragged and dropped into a new position on the page. It can be swapped for another type of block without changing its content. It can be copied and pasted into a different document without losing its content and structure.

<img width="" src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x300" alt="" />

{annotated diagram of swapping blocks and dragging and dropping blocks}

Blocks open up a world of flexibility and interactive power within a scoped area. They're easier to move around – a key quality for anyone working with ideas who needs to arrange and rearrange information in relationships to find the right groupings and sequences – which is to say, all of us doing knowledge work.

## A History of Blocks

If I asked you to guess when blocks and block-based editors first appeared, I'd expect the audience to split into two camps with very different time scales:

<Blocktimeline />

To prove this point, I ran a quick Twitter poll to gauge the level of historical awareness around block-editors within a small audience of fairly well-informed programmers and interface nerds <Footnote idName={8}>I don't have hard stats on the demographics of my twitter followers, but I'd summarise the group as web developers, tools for thought enthusiasts, and interface designers. In that order.</Footnote>:

<TweetEmbed tweetId="1486694395583901709" />

Let's first acknowledge my poll is fundamentally flawed given that it offers my predicted answers by default, and requires people go to the effort of replying if they have an alternate view.

The question itself was also duplicitous. Trying to pin-point a single "invention moment" by one person or project in history is a fool's errand. Especially in the field of interface design where every new creation is a bric-a-brac recompilation of existing conventions and standards.

But we all make compromises to run reductive, ad-hoc twitter polls.

There were plenty of write-in replies that included [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard), Douglas Engelbart's [NLS System](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system)>), [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson), and the [Pygmalion](http://acypher.com/wwid/Chapters/01Pygmalion.html) visual programming language. All of whom I'd agree played a role in the development of block-based interfaces. Many of them described or implemented software patterns that could easily be interpreted as block-like. We'll take a closer look at these in a minute.

I wasn't surprised to find most people attribute the interface pattern to Notion. Notion was certainly not the first or last block editor, but it's easily the most visible and widely used to date. It predecessors are not immediately obvious, and do a poor job of self-promotion.

This is compounded by the fact the web development and design industry is reasonably oblivious to historical precedent. This isn't out of laziness or ambivalence. We're not an industry with well-established intellectual centres, academic legacies, or official degrees yet. None of us were required to take Web History 101 before FTP-ing up our weird Flash sites.

In my experience, most of the people with holistic, comprehensive understandings of computing and interface design history belong to 🤑 elite 🤑 institutions and spend their time writing academic PDFs to one another, rather than openly teaching online, or advising interface designers and product strategy teams. But I digress.

To make sense of this historical trajectory, I've split the evolution of blocks into three distinct ages:

<BlockAges />

Each of these time frames saw a surge in projects that explored the qualities that led to block-based interfaces. These early efforts addressed pragmatic issues like ecosystem integration, UX usability, and hardware capacity.

### The First Age of Blocks – Xanadu, NLS, and Hypercard

<h5 style={{ marginTop: "-0.6rem" }}>1965-1987</h5>

Frankly, the history of any modern interface pattern has to start in California in the late 1960's and early 70's with the work of Ted Nelson, Douglas Engelbart, and Xerox PARC. The interface waters we currently swim in – of desktop metaphors, click-and-point interactions, and direct manipulation – all lead back to the same river. Blocks are no exception.

And as with most things, Ted Nelson said it first. In 1974 Nelson wrote Computer Lib / Dream Machines, where he laid out elaborate plans for [[Project Xanadu]] – a hypertext system designed for writing "serious electronic literature."

That system involved documents made up of 'parts', which could be any data type, and could be freely moved around a document. Being able to insert a part into multiple documents, link parts to one another, and easily rearrange parts within a document were all essential to the concept.

{image of xanadu's parts}

While Nelson is infamous for being the first to coin concepts, his projects are also infamous for never manifesting into real software. Xanadu was never built, which makes it difficult to evaluate whether its elaborate architecture was truly feasible.

Working in the same realm as Nelson was Douglas Engelbart. In 1969 Engelbart gave [the mother of all demos]() showcasing a graphical interface, hyperlinks, point and click interactions, and live video conferencing all at once. His NLS - oNLine System – used flexible parts of a document that could be rearranged. This feels tangentially related to the way blocks work now, but still set the precedent for flexible data structures and dynamic documents.

{image of NLS}

The last meaningful project in this period was Hypercard which came out of Apple in 1987.

{image of hypercard}

These projects are all spiritual predecesors in this story. The interfaces patterns they established moved us closer to thinking in blocks.

### The Second Age of Blocks – Microsoft OLE and Open Doc

<h5 style={{ marginTop: "-0.6rem" }}>1994-1997</h5>

The idea of creating stacks of uniquely typed blocks inside documents first emerged in the early 1990's.

Microsoft developed a system that allowed users to select an "object" created in one Microsoft application and embed it in another. This **Object Linking and Embedding (OLE)** technology meant you could select a set of cells in Microsoft Excel, copy it, and then paste it into a Microsoft Word document. 'Embedding' the Excel object into Word.

{OLE diagram}

In the parlance of the time, these were called "compound documents"

Microsoft's OLE was the first implementation that made block-based documents possible. Despite this big pragmatic leap, they let their imaginations stop short. OLE didn't seem to spur any dreams beyond copying and pasting bits of Microsoft applications into one another.

Apple stepped up with a vision that aimed to compete with OLE, but took the idea to its full potential. OpenDoc was a programme that flipped the concept of how applications worked on its head. It proposed a compound document made up of multiple small applications, things it called "parts" – similar to our modern day blocks, but more ambitious.

{OpenDoc diagram}

If we're just going off the promotional videos, OpenDoc is the clear winner in this popularity contest:

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFJdjk2rq4E" />

There's still a strong contingent of OpenDoc enthusiasts around. Lamenting its death, analysing what went wrong, and waiting for the idea to re-emerge.

<TweetEmbed tweetId="1389236351711731712" />

### The Third Age of Blocks – Gutenberg, Notion, and the Cambrian Explosion

<h5 style={{ marginTop: "-0.6rem" }}>2014-present</h5>

Starting in 2014 we entered the third age of the block.

In this context, despite being the most visible and widely used block-editor to date, Notion was quite late to the game.
It's undeniable Notion has been the most influential platform championing and pushing the boundaries of block-based editing in recent years.

But Notion certainly didn't come up with blocks.

Tumblr - {original tumblr interface}

Wordpress started work on Gutenberg in 2012(?) and released its first version in 2014(?).

Notion's first release in 2018 kicked things into high gear here. While Wordpress Gutenberg has been out for X years, it served a small use case; writing blog posts. Notion reframed the block editor as an everyday tool – a place to write collaborative documents for your team, or even just yourself. It turned it into an editor you live in, rather than a publishing tool for a specific purpose.

It is exceptionally ironic that when Micrososoft announced their new project "Microsoft Loop" in X, it was lambasted across Twitter as a "shameless Notion clone."

These editors are sometimes belittled as "Notion clones", although Notion was not the first or last platform to implement the conceptual model of documents composed of blocks. Nevertheless, it became a touchstone reference point – a software category in its own right. Like _Uber for X_, we now have _Notion, but with Y feature_.

## Blocks of the Future

### Future patterns

1. Composable blocks  
   Blocks can contain other blocks

2. Independent Block development  
   This was the original dream of OpenDoc. The people who build block-editors don't necessarily have to be the same people who build blocks.

Coda's maker marketplace is one of the recent signs we're moving in this direction.

We've already been moving swiftly in this direction in the larger context of front-end web development. Modular components built by a wide variety of other engineers is the name of the game. We all rely upon open collective efforts like MUI, Chakra, Radix, Reach UI, etc.

The same will happen with blocks, which are a simply a very specific type of component – one designed for authoring documents on the web.

A big disclaimer on this one. I lead design at HASH, where one of our projects is the Block Protocol – a standardised way for blocks to communicate with their embedding applications (aka. block-editors)

{ diagram }

I certainly have a vested interest in the block ecosystem diversifying and maturing.

3. Diversifying block types

As blocks become a more standardised interface approach, we should expect to see a wider diversity of block types.

4. Blocks as end-user programming

The biggest hope I have for blocks is as an entry point into front-end development for people who can't currently code.

Button blocks on Coda and Retool are big indicators of this.

5. Improved open, indie web publishing tooling

Enabling users to write rich content to the independent, open web. Web 2.0 enabled users to write to the web... within limitations. They can only write to "platforms" - FB, twitter. The platform owners control and own the content.

6. The Modular Web

Standing up a whole website has moved far beyond the capacities of most people. Sandboxed environments like Observable and Jupyter notebook give people the ability to write code and execute it without also needing to learn the command line, Webpack, DNS redirects, etc. etc.

The web was born as a text-first medium. Tim Berners Lee designed it to mimic text documents. Specifically, long, linear research documents shared among scientists and academics as pieces of paper. Ever since then we've been negotiating its paper-like qualities.

The text-first, document-based model comes with a lot of design implications. It presumes the document or page is the basic unit of the web. We store our metadata at the level of the page, usually in the `<head>` tag. We link at the page level, rather than at the word, paragraph, or section level. <Footnote idName={1}>This has improved slightly with #header-level links, but the vast majority of links are still to entire pages, not granular lines or sections within a page.</Footnote>
