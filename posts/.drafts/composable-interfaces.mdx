<h2 className="micro">The Context</h2>

Designers and developers of software hold an enourmous amount of power. We have the power to decide what kind of software gets built, what it should do, what activities it should enable, and who will be allowed to use it.

This power balance is precarious. Most people working in software are reasonably well-intentioned, and spend a great deal of effort trying to serve and empower the people who use their creations – the "end-users". Users are held up as the ultimate source of truth; we interview them, watch them closely, and ask them cryptic questions about their needs and wants. We try desperately to figure out what their _problems_ are and _solve_ them by writing little stories to ourselves: “As a social media manager, I want to schedule the officialy company tweets ahead of time, so that I can take a long coffee break with Susan for most of the afternoon”

This business of trying to give users what they want and need is exceptionally difficult. We often get it wrong. We attempt to solve problems that software cannot solve. We get distracted by competing factors; time, budgets, internal politics, shareholders, and sociopathic stakeholders.

The classic example of a composable interface is a dashboard. I should note not all dashboard are composable; only ones that allow users to add and remove ‘widgets’ and select from a library of widgets
