<h2 className="micro">The Context</h2>

Being able to quickly capture a new idea, a loose piece of information, or a vaguely formed thought is a critical feature of any worthwhile knowledge management system.<Footnote idName={1}>Also known as a note-taking system, but with a bit more emphasis on creating _personal knowledge_ rather than just creating _notes_</Footnote>

When you need to get an idea down, you want to get into an open text input as fast as possible. Ideally within a single click or keystroke. You don't want to think about what to name the page it will live on, where it fits into your existing information architecture, or what other ideas it should be linked to.

Half the time I begin typing something, I'm not even sure what I'm writing yet. Writing it out is an essential part of thinking it out.

Once I've captured it, re-read it, and probably rewritten it, I can then worry about what to label it, what it connects to, and where it should 'live' in my system.

And sometimes (perhaps often), I stare at the written note and I'm _still_ not sure where to put it. It connects to many other bits of information and themes. It doesn't neatly fit into a single labelled folder. I have to think hard about _when_ I want to see this idea again. I have to make it findable for future me.

This organising work takes a non-trivial amount of mental effort, and there are plenty of moments when I can't be bothered. And I am not alone in this.

Sometimes we need to capture ideas and then let them sit for a while. Before we shift to organising and synthesising them. They need to hang out in limbo, uncategorised, in a place we can still find and revisit them.

This presents a problem for designers of these systems; how do we give people open, free-flowing, and unstructured inputs... that allow them to consistently rediscover, revisit, and organise their loose ideas and snippets?

<h2 className="micro">The Pattern</h2>

The Daily Notes Page (colloquially, the DNP) is one of the most popular solutions to the problem of balancing frictionless input with future discoverability.

The DNP is usually an entry point â€“ you begin there by default when you open the app. Every day, a fresh blank page appears with today's date at the top. And you are free to begin writing in it.

Each day becomes a reference point. When you encounter that note again in the future,

### Daily Templates

Setting up templates that auto-fill your DNP has become popular among the users of apps like Obsidian, Roam, and Logseq.

### Potential Problems and Consequences

The DNP solves a tricky problem, but like all solutions, comes with costs.

It frames the personal knowledge management system as a diary. It lends itself well to keeping daily logs; of your activities, emotions, and thoughts over 24 hours. Some people love this aspect. Freeform journaling can clear the mind and encourage self-reflection and metacognition.

And yet it's not always what we want to use a knowledge base for. Mixing up your notes on XXX and your reflections on XXX can lead to uncomfortable context collapse.
