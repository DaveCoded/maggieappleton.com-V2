<IntroParagraph>

The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) community recently hosted an open, [barcamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp)-style session [on personal libraries](https://indieweb.org/2022/Pop-ups/Personal_Libraries). Specifically, how to create systems on the open web where people can publish their personal book collections, share and find other people's book lists, and generally use books as a medium to connect with each other.

</IntroParagraph>

You can do most of these things via existing platforms; Goodreads being the canonical example. You can track your reading, write reviews, join reading groups, and browse curated book lists. But like all private, walled gardens, it comes with a few predictable catches:

- Your library data belongs to Goodreads and you'll have trouble ever getting it out again. <Footnote idName={1}>Goodreads used to provide an API for developers, but as of [December 2020](https://www.goodreads.com/api/documentation) they no longer issue new keys. There's probably good reason for this, but it speaks to fundamental issues of access and power in closed ecosystems</Footnote> If Goodreads goes down, it'll take all your books, groups, and connections with it.
- You have no power or agency as a user to adapt or extend the Goodreads system to fit your own needs. You have to accept and use whatever features and affordances the product managers, designers, and developers of Goodreads deem important.

This doesn't make Goodreads evil. It makes it unappealing for people who care about long-term resiliency, open data on the web, and end-users having agency over their tools.

The pop-up session focused on exploring alternatives to closed platforms; what pieces of infrastructure might enable us to build a 'decentralized Goodreads'? Plenty of us publish personal libraries to the web, but rarely in common formats that can talk to one another or pool data into communal centres to find connections and relationships.

## Data Exchange Formats

Most of the pop-up focused on the issue of data exchange formats. How do we get independent websites to agree on a common format for books? This includes both the format the data is passed between sites in (RSS, JSON, OPML, CSV), and the shape of the data itself.

The [Library](/library) and [Antilibrary](/antilibrary) book collections on this site are perfect examples of poorly formatted data that can't be read by other sites. They're currently generated by an object in [a JavaScript file](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/maggieappleton.com-V2/blob/main/posts/data/books.js) that has some basic data and links out to Google books:

```js
export const bookData = [
  {
    title: "Computers as Theatre",
    author: "Brenda Laurel",
    cover: "/images/books/theatre.jpg",
    link: "https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Computers_as_Theatre/NedQAAAAMAAJ",
  },
  {
    title: "Everything, All the Time, Everywhere",
    subtitle: "How We Became Postmodern",
    author: "Stuart Jeffries",
    cover: "/images/books/everything.jpg",
    link: "https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Everything_All_the_Time_Everywhere/pchGEAAAQBAJ",
  },
  {
    title: "The Design of Everyday Things",
    author: "Don Norman",
    cover: "/images/books/designthings.jpg",
    link: "https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things/heCtnQEACAAJ",
  },
];
```

I have a title, author, a cover image in a local image folder, and a link to the book record on Google Books. This might be all I need to display a bunch of books on my library page, but it's poorly designed from an interoperability standpoint.

I'd never considered the limitations of this approach before the event, only because I hadn't thought ahead to the possiblity of publishing this list in ways others could consume it. <Footnote idName={2}>I also built this website under the mantra of "do the bare minimum and no more" so it's a garden of low-hanging fruit</Footnote>

Just at the level of standardising what properties exist on a single book, we'd need to all agree to a common core set. Title, author, and a UID (unique identification) number would be enough to distinguish between books – ISBN's are fairly standard for UIDs.

People in the pop-up suggested additional nice-to-have properties like reading status (to read, reading, read), page count, related notes, reading start and end dates, rating (out of 5), and genre/tags.

A few people reasonably pointed out we'll never have a single, unified format. It's better to pursue forgiving and flexible standards that enable people to publish books in a variety of formats. And instead build tools that can translate between formats and map properties from one type to another.

### Prior art and existing systems

This problem space isn't new and plenty of people have built pieces of the potential solution.

[Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/) wrote a piece proposing [Library JSON](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/04/15/library-json/) - a standard format for book data exchange. [Tom Zijlstra](https://www.zylstra.org/) adapted it to [OPML format](https://www.zylstra.org/blog/booklist-opml-data-structure/) <Footnote idName={2}>OMPL = Outline processor markup language. A format used to import and export from RSS feeds.</Footnote>using the properties defined on Schema.org's [Book type](https://schema.org/Book).

Publishing feeds in either JSON or RSS would allow us to create streams of books and subscribe to them using existing systems. Working with RSS feeds and writing JSON isn't the most user friendly interface though. Most people outside the world of web development would need something closer to a traditional GUI to manage their collections. Some people suggested spreadsheets as an accessible interface format.

Another possibility is encouraging people to shift from platforms like Goodreads over to more open platforms with API access. The Internet Archive has setup [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org) which is a non-profit, open-source book catalogue. They have [an API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) that allows you to fetch book information like covers, authors, and lists (currently reading, best sci-fi novels, etc.).

## Ad Hoc Reading Groups

An idea I brought to the event and ended up hosting a session on was _ad hoc reading groups_ – discussions and meetups faciliatated by our public bookshelves.

Personal bookshelves on websties are a jazzy feature, but it's sometimes unclear what they're _for_. What does publishing a personal library to the web _do_ for us?

They certainly help lay contextual groundwork for people visiting our personal websites. They tell others what kind of ideas we've encountered and what disciplines we've studied.

They also work well as invitations. Books are an easy starting point for conversation; "oh you read that too!". People frequently reference a book from my shelf when they first send a Twitter DM or email.
