<h2 className="micro">The Context</h2>

Most mainstream programming interfaces are designed around the paradigm of linear text documents. IDEs and code editors are primarily text editors with a handful of extra plugins and helpers.

To create the basic elements of programmes such as objects, classes, and functions, we type special keywords like `const`, `var`, `let`, `class` and `def`. Or sometimes even more obtuse syntax combinations like `(() -> {...})`

Text-based programming languages are the norm because they're incredibly efficient to write and flexible enough to construct grand castles of abstract logic with. In short, they scale well.

But since the early days of a programming, many people have found this purely textual approach flawed. The highly visual, spatial, and embodied nature of human cognition makes it hard for us to reason about things we cannot see representations of or directly manipulate.

The exploration of graphical, spatial, and embodied programming interfaces is often labelled “Visual programming” or ”Graphical programming.” It goes all the way back to the 1950's with Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad demo.

<h2 className="micro">The Pattern</h2>

Node and wire programming interfaces use a spatial canvas as the primary interface metaphor, rather than a linear document of text.

They present an open space for you to write your programme on. Your programme is composed of "nodes" - typically a box or block that holds some lines of code or a transformation of data – and "wires" which are the connections between them.
