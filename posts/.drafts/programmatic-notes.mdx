<h2 className="micro">The Context</h2>

Most "note-taking" or "knowledge management" software acts as a passive storage container. You write notes in, and they sit there until you actively go searching for them. If you never go searching for them, you never see those ideas again.

This warehouse approach to notes requires us – the human agent in the system – to do a **lot** of cognitive labour. We have to remember what kind of information we put into the warehouse in the first place. We have to know what keywords will allow us to find it again. We have to develop practices that force us to go looking for material. We have to prompt ourselves to expand our notes, combine them, synthesise them into new realisations, and critique our own conclusions.

There are plenty of cultural practices around knowledge management that help us do this kind of difficult cognitive work; the [Zettelkasten method](), [[Evergreen Notes]], [knowledge synthesis](), regularly writing for an engaged and critical public audience, signing up for expensive master's degrees.

But we've yet to see many of these practices enabled by software.
