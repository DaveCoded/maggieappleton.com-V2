<h2 className="micro">The Context</h2>

Since the 1980's, GUI's <Footnote idName={1}>Graphical user interfaces</Footnote> have been the primary interface paradigm for personal computers. Every app presents users with a set of familiar graphical objects: windows, sidebars, modals, popovers, cards, sliders, and buttons. We use these to create, edit, and delete the abstract things in our digital systems – our todo items, photos, emails, documents, and the like.

It's hard to concieve of a time when this wasn't the case. Yet before the GUI, typing obscure text commands into a CLI (command line inteface) was the only way to get a computer to do something for you. `mkdir summer_trip && cd summer_trip && touch plans.txt && open plans.txt` did the work of the “Create New Folder” and “New Document” buttons.

The world of CLI's had plenty of issues. People had to memorise . Findability, discoverability, and feedback were lacking. {cite}. The direct manipulation and familiarity of the GUI vastly improved the usability of computers. {cite}

But every design choice has its costs. Despite improving computer usability for many people, GUIs also created a great divide. There were now two distinct kinds of interfaces for two distinct kinds of people; GUI's for computer users, and CLI's for computer programmers.
