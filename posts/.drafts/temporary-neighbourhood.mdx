<h2 className="micro">The Context</h2>

Creating a sense of shared space is one of the hardest design challenges of the web.

Here we are in an asynchronous exchange. I've written these words in the past. And you're here to read them at some point in the future. We're both "_visting_" the same URL, the same web"_site_", which suggests a shared location. But these linguistic metaphors are nothing like sharing presence in a real location in meatspace. We have no visual, audible, physical awareness of one another.

This sense of shared presence certainly improved with the rise of "Web 2.0" social-media-driven live updating web apps. You can see other people's tweets and posts and likes and shares and hearts appear in real time. The sense of other humans is palpable. But it's still paltry compared to the real thing. We're seeing fleeting suggestions of other people's thumb taps. Generic, anonymised phone taps.

Our personalised live streams of content give us a sense of immediacy, but they still lack everything else about shared space; directionality, awareness of those around us, opportunities for ad hoc interactions, freedom to explore, and most ciritically, a shared understanding we are seeing the same reality as people in our immediate vicinity. There is no '_vicinity_' when you are an individual staring down a content stream that no one else will ever see or know.
