<IntroParagraph>

The term **tools for thought** has become a new rallying point over the last few years. People who might otherwise gather around keywords like personal knowledge management (PKM), note-taking, networked thought, computer-supported collaborate work (CSCW), knowledge graphs, or human-computer interaction (HCI), are reframing their work.

</IntroParagraph>

There are meetups and research groups and thought leaders. But more than anything, people are using the term to describe a new class of software. _Tools for thought_ is now a category tag in the databases of venture capital firms. The phrase appears on the landing page of every hot new note-taking app:

alt="Kosmik App"
/>

Even when it doesn't appear verbatim, we can see it in the subtext. These tools are here to help you “think better,” and achieve “networked thought”.

These software apps appear to have a clear vision of what a "tool for thought" is. It appears to involve writing notes, connecting them to one another, exploring dynamic views, and then experiencing a kind of emergent wisdom. An enchanting promise.

Yet there's something paradoxical here; the phrase itself and the way we're collectively using it feel misaligned. Taken at face value, the phrase _tool for thought_ doesn't have the word 'computer' or 'digital' anywhere in it. It suggests nothing about software systems or interfaces. It's simply meant to refer to tools that help humans think thoughts; potentially new, different, and better kinds of thoughts than we currently think.

While this might seem like a dumb rhetorical question, **what does any of this have to do with computers?**

I think it's a question worth answering explicitly and comprehensively. If only to make clear to ourselves why we currently consider apps that allow you to link notes together the epitome of a _tool for thought_.

## What is a tool for thought?

We're a bit too early in the establishment of this concept for anyone to have written a canonical definition yet. And like all significantly complex ideas, any proposed ones will be contested and controversial.

We can, however, get a rough estimation by looking at descriptions from some of the key texts we pass around the community:

<BlockquoteCitation

formerly impossible for them”</BlockquoteCitation>

Looking a these, it's easy to think of plenty of examples from human history of _tools for thought_ that fit the bill. Here's a brief list:

Hard to overstate this one. Allows us to precisely record and communicate
our ideas across vast amounts of time and areas of space. Both to
ourselves and to others.

Drawing feels so fundamental it's hard to think about it as a tool people
developed. But at some point a person painted the first animal on a cave
wall. Since then it's been one of the primary ways we represent thought
and communicate meaning through spatial relationships and symbols. It did
all the heavy lifting before written language emerged.

Visual maps showing routes through landscapes and layouts of cities
enabled us to form mental models of physical spaces we had never been to
or seen with our own eyes. Shifts us from an “egocentric” view of the
world to an “allocentric” bird's eye view. Take a look at Barbara
Tversky's

for more on visual explanations and maps as tools for thought.

Epic poetry used techniques of metrics and rhythm to commit long stories

through song. The most famous examples being the Epic of Gilgamesh and The
Mahabhrata which survived long enough to be written down.

Songlines are physical paths through the Australian landscape that
Aborigianal people have used for tens of thousands of years as mnemonic
devices. They have songs they sing that correlate to specific paths and
encode information about the land, political and social rules, and
cultural knowledge. Similar to
[method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci), but shown to be more effective in memorising vast quantities of information.

We can debate the _degree_ to which each of these examples fits our understanding of a “tool for thought”. But I'd argue they each profoundly transform the kinds of thoughts humans are able to think. They expand our cognitive abilities and allow us to solve problems that would otherwise be unsolvable.

It might feel strange to call some of these things “tools”. The scientific and socratic methods seem more like _techniques_ for problem-solving. While drawing and writing are surely _mediums_ or _representations_ of ideas rather than “tools”?

Part of this discomfort is a limitation of language. “Tool” is a tricky category that we most often associate with physical objects. But it can encompass everything from fire to a whittling knife to software development kits to democratic voting systems. We could spend time splitting hairs and trying to eliminate things from the category. Or we could choose to be generous in our definition and accept any object, cultural practice, technique, or medium that expands humans abilities as a _tool_.

Which gives us a mental model that looks something like this:

<BasicImage
margin="0 auto var(--space-s)"
width="800px"
alt="A diagram of the category of tools encompassing cultural practices, techniques, objects, and mediums"
src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1100/v1651476166/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools-for-thought/Screenshot_-_2022-05-02_08.22.24_wjcvln.png"
/>

Of all the examples I listed above, I would put most of them in the “cultural practice and techniques” category. They certainly aren't objects. Some are certainly mediums; forms of representation such as writing and images. But mediums also require technique – you must be taught _how_ to write before you can use the medium of written language.

They are primary **ways of doing**; what I would call **cultural practices**. They are specific ways of thinking and acting that result in greater cognitive abilities. Ones that people pass down to generation after generation through culture.

Every one of these also pre-dates digital computers by at least a few hundred years, if not thousands or tens of thousands. Given that framing, it's time to return to the question of how computation, software objects, and note-taking apps fit into this narrative.

## The Computational Roots of Tools for Thought

My simple interpretation of “tools for thought” up to this point takes the phrase at face value – devoid of any historical context. Any sincere and holistic exporation of TFT has to consider _who_ came up with the term, and what particular _cultural and historical contexts_ they were part of. 

Every person who has written about and extensively explored the term in their work is a computer programmer of some variety; Kenneth Iverson, JCR Licklider, Alan Kay, Douglas Englebart, Seymour Papert, Bret Victor, and Howard Rheingold, among others. I would be remiss not to point out they are also all male, white, from North America, and associated with various prestigious universities such as MIT, Caltech, Stanford, and UC Berkley. Which is relevant only to point out that they likely share a lot of the same cultural beliefs, values, and context.

“Tools for thought” as a concept and philosophical mission began in the heart of the personal computing and interface design scene of the 1960-1980's. TFT has always been used in relation to a dream that is deeply intertwined with digital machines.

The phrase was first used by Kenneth Iverson in his research work on programming notation throughout the 1950's and 60's.<Footnote idName={1}>Andy Matuschak and Michael Neilson, <a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/">(2019)</a></Footnote> His first public paper mentioning it is [Notation as a Tool for Thought](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358896.358899) published by the ACM in 1979<Footnote isClosed idName={2}>The Association for Computing Machinery; the institutional big wigs of academic computer science</Footnote>.

While Iverson was the first to give this idea a distinct name, others were exploring many of the same themes using different language. The most significant body of work along these same lines is Douglas Engelbart's [Augmenting Human Intellect](https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html), published in 1962. He used terms like "intelligence augmentation" and "intelligence amplification" rather than "tools for thought," but is clearly on the same wavelength.

Howard Rheingold picked it as the title of his 1985 book [Tools for Thought](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/tools-thought) – a history of the major innovations that led to the personal computer, and some speculative on how computing would unfold throughout the 1990's.

Rheingold tells the story of what he calls the patriarchs, pioneers, and infonauts of the computer, focusing in particular on such pioneers as J. C. R. Licklider, Doug Engelbart, Bob Taylor, and Alan Kay

Alan Kay's User interface essay

Bret Victor's 2013-2015 Talks


The end of 2019
[Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) and [Michael Neilson](https://michaelnielsen.org/)'s 2019 essay on [transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) helped kick off the new popularity wave, as well as Andy's [continued research](https://www.patreon.com/quantumcountry) and writing advocating for TFT as a field.

<ImageFrame

All of these computer scientists exclusively focus on _computers_ as essential to enabling new ways of thinking. They aren't exploring how architecture, or physical product design, or music composition might enable new kinds of thoughts. The computer is essential.

It would be more accurate to rename tools for thought to _computational mediums for thought_. Or CMFT for short.

CMFT would actually be a subset of the larger field of tools for thought, since as we established earlier, the vast majority of historical tools for thought are not in the least bit computational.

/* image of CMFT as a subset of TFT */

Which should make us pause to ask: Are CMFT's significantly different to other TFTs?
