In the early 2010's we got something magical on the web; a new class of libraries that made building interactive JavaScript components _much_ easier.

-   Google led the way with Angular 1 in 2010
-   Ember and Bootstrap in 2011
-   React and Vue in 2013

We're now swimming in JavaScript [Component Toolkits](https://bestofjs.org/projects?tags=component)

Sure, the web had interactive components before we smeared JavaScript all over it. Plenty of HTML elements allow you to interact with them.

An HTML `<button>` is certainly interactive.

<button>Click Me</button>

As are input `<select>` menus, checkboxes, and `<summary>` dropdowns.

<select>
    <option>The First Option</option>
    <option>Another One</option>
    <option>Bunch of Options Here</option>
</select>

<input type="text"></input>
<input type="checkbox"></input>

<details>
    <summary>I'm a summary</summary>
    I'm a detail
</details>

There's a limit to the amount of interactive fun we can have with these though. To have true feedback loops between a component and the person using it, we need a few more programmatic tools like variables, event handlers, and state.

If I want that button to do anything, it needs a JavaScript function attached to it.

`<button onClick={fireTheCannons}>Click Me</button>`

To get the pedantic definitional debate out of the way, by "components" I mean reusable, interactive blocks of content on the web with a specific purpose. We might also call these _widgets_, _blocks_ or _web thingamabobs_

The best definitions are always examples. Here's what I mean:

This is a calendar component.

This is an animation component.

This component gives you contextual information.

This component tells you how flour to use for a pound cake.

Given that rich web components are only a decade old, we're still in the toddler phase of making them accessible to everyone.

By _accessible_ I don't mean a11y accessible to _use_ (although it's critical whatever we build on the web is useable by everyone). I mean accessible to _create_.

I'm talking about [[End User Programming]] here.
