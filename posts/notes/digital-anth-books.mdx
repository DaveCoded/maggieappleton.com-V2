<IntroParagraph>

As a [Digital Anthropology](/digital-anthropology) enthusiast and practioner-in-training, I'm often asked for reading recommendations that are are good entry points into the field. I've compiled a list of gateway drugs.

</IntroParagraph>

This is a collection of books, talks, documentaries, articles, and academic paper that are a mix of "essential reads," plus some of my personal picks.  
It will give you a sweeping overview of what digital anthropologists tend to spend their time thinking about and researching.

Most of them aren't overly academic, so you don't need to worry about trugding through too much Foucauldian theory or references to Marxist [reification](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(Marxism)>) (no promises though, sometimes it just comes out of left field).
