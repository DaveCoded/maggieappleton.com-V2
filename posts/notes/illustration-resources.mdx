<IntroParagraph>

People who want to improve their drawing and illustration skills [[frequently ask]] what books, courses, and resources I recommend. Trying to Google it leads to an overwhelming pile of cruft and most of the great resources aren't anywhere on the first 10 pages of search results.

</IntroParagraph>

I've compiled all my favourite learning platforms, courses, and books below to help guide you towards the good stuff. Everything below will help teach you how to work in the [[meat and medium]] of visual language, rather than focusing on the materials (the "which iPad should I buy?" distraction). <Footnote idName={1}>If you desperately want to focus on tooling, you can read about the hardware and software I use over on [What App is That?](/apps)</Footnote>

I've personally read every book and taken every course on this page, so can at least vouch for it first-hand. But be aware it's not exhaustive. The volume of illustration education avaliable online is constantly growing and I don't keep close tabs on it anymore.

<LinkCard url="http://bit.ly/35UyJ8l" title="Schoolism" author="$25 Monthly" image="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1638779716/maggieappleton.com/notes/illustration-resources/schoolism_upphcl.png">

Primarily aimed at concept artists and digital painters, Schoolism is strong
on advanced fundamentals. Probably too intense for beginners. Dives deep on
rendering, composition, and character design.

While a bit old school and slow-paced, the instructors on here are true veterans. Many are classical painters and sculpters, or come from the visual development and film world. They're strong on anatomy, traditional painting yechniques, and compositional layout theory.

Strong on beginner fundamentals – great for anyone just getting started. Jake Parker and Will Terry teach drawing and digital painting from the ground up through sets of well-designed, hands-on exercises.

Animation, animals, and character design are the focus here. Ex-Disney artist Aaron Blaise leads most of the courses – his teaching style is friendly and laid-back. These courses assume basic drawing skills and cover more advanced topics.
