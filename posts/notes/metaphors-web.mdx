<IntroParagraph>

In Tim Berners-Lee's [original pitch](https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html) for The Web, he described it as a "non-linear text system" for notes. It was designed for scientific researchers and academics to pass around documents that would otherwise be printed on physical paper. The _point_ of the web was to mimic long, text-based, paper documents, but simply make them easier to move around.

</IntroParagraph>

**Paper documents** were the original metaphor for the web.

Ever since Alan Kay came up with the [desktop metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_metaphor) at XEROX Parc in the 1970's, our whole digital experience has been structured in terms of dull office equipment. Documents, folders, physical inboxes, rubbish bins, bookmarks, windows, and post-its are still part of the visual language of our operating systems today.

This way of thinking about computer interfaces as physical office rooms naturally expanded into how we think about the web. Websites are primaily thought about and spoken of as **pages** – as in, _pieces of paper_. We tend to imagine the web as a series of paper documents with text and images presented on them.

The page you're reading this on still mimics paper. We still call it a _page_ or an HTML _document_. It follows the same typographic rules and conventions – black text on white backgrounds and a top-to-bottom / left-to-right heirarchical structure.

## Escaping Paper

Despite the persistent metaphor of the paper-based web, we've framed this system in many other ways since its creation. We called it a [series of tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes), an information superhighway, a surf-able ocean of information, a global village, a town square, and a zero-gravity parallel universe known as _cyberspace_.

Out of all of these metaphors, the two most enduring are paper and physical space.

This is obvious in the way we speak about the web. Our words describe the web as a sprawling expanse of place-based pages – each piece has in it's own location we step into when we **visit** a **homepage**. We **go to** web**sites**. They have a permanent **address** – each URL (uniform resource **locator**) marks its place in digital space. We **follow** links and end up **on** a page, and go **back** to the previous page.

Despite the common folklore that we shouldn't mix metaphors, we have no problem seeing the web as both paper and place at the same time. It's a classic example of **conceptual blending** – the mind's ability to combine multiple metaphors at once and from them produce emergent meaning. – we've seamlessly combined the two to create an emergent notion of location-based pages.

As George Lakoff and Mark Johnson made clear in their touchstone book Metaphors We Live By, metaphors are the basis of all human thought and reasoning. The metaphors we use to speak about the web are not simply linguistic trivia – they determine how we understand it on a fundamental level. It determines what we think the web is capable of, what risks, opportunities, and challenges it poses. Which means the metaphors we use to think about the web **profoundly influence** what we think the web is, what we think we can do with it, and how we might change or evolve it.

## The Static Nature of Paper

This metaphor of _the-web-as-paper_ works quite well. The otherwise immaterial and abstract nature of the web becomes understandable, familiar, and (most importantly) _usable_ through the paper metaphor.

However, it's important to point out that websites and paper do not share any _inherent_ qualities. We purposefully designed webpages to look like paper, but it wasn't some inevitable metaphorical fate.

Trying on different metaphorical lenses changes what we think the web is made of, what we think it can do, it's affordances, risks, and restrictions.

Rather than seeing the web as a flat, inert object we passively read, what if we saw the web as an interactive topology made up of various layers?

If you know anything about how our current web infrastructure came into existence, you're well aware the whole thing is a patchwork of technologies held together with duct tape. It is the furthest thing from a uniform system developed by a centralised team of developers.

Each piece of the modern web was built seperately. Unrelated individuals and teams of developers added layer upon layer. Each one building on top of existing systems, protocols, and standards.
