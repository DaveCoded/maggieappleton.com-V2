<IntroParagraph>

Now, and for the rest of my brief life, I'll be trying to write narrative non-fiction that isn't entirely crap. I'm not a _Writer_, but I write in order to explore others things – anthropology, weird cultural quirks in the web development community, interaction design, and the rising field of "tools for thought".

</IntroParagraph>

Perhaps you're the same kind of non-_Writer_ writer. The playful amateur kind, using it explore and communicate ideas, rather than making the medium part of your identity. But even amateurs want to be good. _I_ certainly want to get good.

Knowing what you like is half the battle in liking what you create. In that spirit, I collect narrative non-fiction essays that I think are exceptional. They're worth looking at closely – their opening moves, sentence structure, turns of phrase, and narrative arcs.

<p>
  [[Echoing]] the work of other writers is the only sensible way to improve your
  own writing. Good artists copy, great artists steal quotes from Picasso.
</p>

You may want to start your own collection of lovely essays like this. There will certainly be some Real Writers who find my list trite and full of basic, mainstream twaddle. It probably is. I've done plenty of self-acceptance work and I'm okay with it.

### [What is Code?](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)

<p class="small-caps">by Paul Ford</p>

Paul Ford explains code in 38,000 words and somehow make it all accessible, technically accurate, narratively compelling, and most of all, culturally insighful and humanistic.

I have unreasonable feelings for this essay. It is, to me, perfect. There are few essays that take the interactive medium of the web seriously, and this one takes the cake. <Footnote idName={1}>Most of the rest live on [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool), though they are focused on data visualisation rather than exploring longform, narrative writing in particular.</Footnote> There is a small blue cube character, logic diagrams, live code snippets to run, GIFs, tangential footnotes, and a certificate of completion at the end.

### [A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again](https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/HarpersMagazine-1996-01-0007859.pdf)

Forgive me for being a David Foster Wallace admirer. The guy clearly had issues, but this account of his 7-day trip on a luxury cruiseliner expresses an inner monologue that is clarifying, rare and often side-splittingly hilarious.

He taught me it is 100% okay to write an entire side-novel in your footnotes if you need to.

### [What’s the Point If We Can’t Have Fun?](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/whats-the-point-if-we-cant-have-fun)

<p class="small-caps">by David Graeber</p>

Graeber explores play and work from an anthropological perspective. He's a master of moving between the specific and the general. Between academic theory and personal storytelling. He's always ready with armfuls of evidence and citations, but doesn't drown you in them.
