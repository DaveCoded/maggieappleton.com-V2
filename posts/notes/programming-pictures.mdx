<AssumedAudience>

Professional developers who are familiar with modern programming interfaces and tools. Ideally JavaScript, but not necessarily.

<IntroParagraph>

This talk – "A Picture Worth a Thousand Programmes" – is an exploration of why we don't use more visual explanations and embodied knowledge in our programming tools.

I first presented it at [React Advanced London](https://reactadvanced.com/) 2021. You can watch the recording on the official conference website:

This is about making pictures. Specifically, making pictures of programmes. Ideally pictures worth a thousand programmes, as the traditional saying goes.

I’ve spent my whole career so far creating visual representations of programmes.

During my time at [egghead](egghead.io) I made hundreds of cover illustrations for the courses we taught.

Each of these would start with an abstract programming concept that I had to find a way to visually represent in a single image

I learned to rely heavily on visual metaphors for these. Styling with CSS became painting a house.
And became organising types in typescript became sorting suits in a deck of cards.

I've also made a lot of illustrated diagrams over the years to explain topics like how JavaScript prototype inheritance works, or what happens when you flatten an array, or how APIs are like small robotic waiters.

The goal of all these illustrations is to make complex technical topics relatable and easier to understand, a theme you’ll hear a lot about in this talk.

I also recently collaborated on a project called [Just JavaScript](justjavascript.com) with [Dan Abramov](overreacted.io)

It’s a JavaScript course that teaches the core mental models of the language through visual diagrams and animations.

We worked together to develop a visual language that was a bit more formal than the previous illustrations I showed.

Every piece of syntax correlated to a specific visual shape, and we used the system to explain concepts like assigning properties and object mutation.

Now, I’m not running through all this work to show off – I just wanted to give you some context around the kind of programming visuals I’ve made in the past so you have a sense what I mean when I refer to ‘pictures of programming’.
