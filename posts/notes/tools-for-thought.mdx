People familiar with the _tools for thought_, personal knowledge management, and notetaking space / twitterverse

</AssumedAudience>

<IntroParagraph>

The term **tools for thought** has become a new rallying point over the last few years. People who might otherwise gather around keywords like personal knowledge management (PKM), note-taking, networked thought, computer-supported collaborate work (CSCW), knowledge graphs, or human-computer interaction (HCI), are reframing their work.

</IntroParagraph>

There are meetups and research groups and thought leaders. But more than anything, people are using the term to describe a new class of software. _Tools for thought_ is now a category tag in the databases of venture capital firms. The phrase appears on the landing page of every hot new note-taking app:

Even when it doesn't appear verbatim, we can see it in the subtext. These tools are here to help you "think better," and achieve "networked thought".

These software apps appear to have a clear vision of what a "tool for thought" is. It appears to involve writing notes, connecting them to one another, exploring dynamic views, and then experiencing a kind of emergent wisdom. An enchanting promise.

Yet there's something paradoxical here; the phrase itself and the way we're collectively using it feel misaligned. Taken at face value, the phrase _tool for thought_ doesn't have the word 'computer' or 'digital' anywhere in it. It suggests nothing about software systems or interfaces. It's simply meant to refer to tools that help humans think thoughts; potentially new, different, and better kinds of thoughts than we currently think.

While this might seem like a dumb rhetorical question, **what does any of this have to do with computers?**

I think it's a question worth answering explicitly and comprehensively. If only to make clear to ourselves why we currently consider apps that allow you to link notes together the epitome of a _tool for thought_.

## What is a tool for thought?

The phrase was first used by Kenneth Iverson in their research work throughout the 1950s and 60s.<Footnote idName={1}>Andy Matuschak and Michael Neilson, "<a href="https://numinous.productions/ttft/">How can we develop transformative tools for thought?</a>" (2019)</Footnote> The first public mention I've found is Iveson's 1979 paper [Notation as a Tool for Thought](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pdf) published by the ACM<Footnote idName={2}>The Association for Computing Machinery; the institutional big wigs of academic computer science</Footnote>. Howard Rheingold picked it as the title of their 1985 book [Tools for Thought](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/tools-thought) â€“ a speculative history of how computing might unfold throughout the 1990's.

[Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) and [Michael Neilson](https://michaelnielsen.org/)'s 2019 essay on [transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) helped kick off the new popularity wave, as well as Andy's [continued research](https://www.patreon.com/quantumcountry) and writing advocating for TFT as a field.

<Draft />

There's something odd in the way people are currently using the term though.

If we take the phrase at face value, as anything that helps humans think different kinds of thoughts, the list of historical examples should certainly include:

- Written language
- Hindu-arabic numeral system
- The Socratic Method
- The Scientific Method
- Data visualisations
- Spreadsheets
- Cartesian coordinates

Most of these things pre-date digital computers by at least a few thousand years .
