<h2 className="micro">Context</h2>

For most of the words we read online, we have a limited amount of context about the writer and how much effort they've put into the piece we're reading.

We might have a name and tiny 32px profile image. We rarely have a rich backstory with a comprehensive educational and professional history at hand.

We don't know how long it took them to write these words, how many hundreds of tabs they read through, or whether they spent years earning a graduate degree on the topic.

If we disagree with their points, we're more likely to be ungenerous Epistemic Peers who assume the worst. They don't know what they're talking about. They've barfed this garbage up in a single, frenzied caffeine rush and haven't so much as opened Google Scholar to check for prior art.

<h2 className="micro">The Pattern</h2>

At the beginning of a piece of writing, the author writes a sentence or two about the **epistemtic status** of the work. This usually covers how much effort they put into researching it, and how sure they are about their conclusions.

Scott Alexander of [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/) was one of the earliest well-known bloggers to do this.

[Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/) adds a numerical "certainty" rating to each post
