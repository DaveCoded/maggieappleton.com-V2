Actually it's worse than dislocated – our narratives and metaphors around data are determined to convince us it **needs no location** because it is _immaterial_.

It lives in **"The Cloud."** It doesn't have a geographical home. It floats about as small fluffy terrabytes circling the globe, able to rain data down on us at the click of a button.

Clouds are such a pleasant metaphor. Weighing nothing, they require no energy sources or physical land or building materials or human labour to maintain. They're transcedental and mystical - playing into our cultural belief system that technology is a form of magic that lives in an alternate land.

That land would be _Cyberspace_ – the parallel universe William Gibson described in the 1980's sci-fi novel [Neuromancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer). We know it well as the blue, slightly transparent, glowing realm of floating dots

Cyberspace is an evocative image that kicked off a unfortunate cultural lie: That the digital world is some place different to the "real," meatspace world. A place that is not subject to the grounded realities of earth. It's free from gravity, time, place, identity, scarcity, law, borders, and data storage limits.

This story created what Nathan Jurgenson calls [Digital Dualism](https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/09/13/digital-dualism-and-the-fallacy-of-web-objectivity/) – the notion that the "_online_" and "_offline_" worlds are two distinct and seperate places rather than one continous reality.

---

If you work in DevOps or backend programming, you're acutely aware the cloud is a series of enormous physical warehouses. Primarily owned by Amazon Web Services.

They require energy and materials and resources to run, and pump out 14% of global carbon emissions. {need to add citation}

Actual humans have to work there. They are responsible for maintenance, cleaning, repair, security, and optimizing "uptime."

**"The Cloud"** renders all those people, materials, places, and resources invisible.

As an overarching mission of the last two decades, this is mostly what "technology" does – it renders human labour and material costs invisible.

It builds tiny black boxes around complex systems and sticks a shiny app on the front. When people ask how the systems work, we mumble something about algorithms and machine learning.

---

"The Cloud" makes it difficult for us to think about data the way we need to.

As something we create, that might belong to us. Something we might even be responsible for and need to protect. Something that has economic value that other people are actively buying and selling to one another right now.

None of those options seem real at the moment. Most of the data you and I have created over the last decade of clicking through the web is in someone else's S3 bucket.

---

What would it look like for data to become grounded, local, and material?

What would it looks like if data storage went the way of coffee into local, artisan, organic data storage shops?

What if these shops focused on creating ways for you to 'see' your data?

What kind of visual design affordances would help us understand that data lives on physcial, material hardware?

Amazon is clearly the Starbucks of the data storage world.

    alt="A pair of coffee cups bearing a logo similar to starbucks, but replaced with amazon's aws logo"
/>

What if the the same way the artisan coffee movement kicked back against Double Soy Venti Caramel Lattes, the artisan data storage movement made the equivalent of an organic, free-trade Chemex pour over?

---

There are obvious issues with these provocations. Cheap, reliable data storage is only possible because of centralised systems of energy and security. Decentralised localisation would need to overcome a whole host of standardisation and security measures.

Research projects like [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) and Tim Berners-Lee's [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/) sound like they're at least exploring solutions. Yes, it involves blockchain. No, of course I don't fully understand.

There are real-life [[Data Unions]] up and running in the world like [Streamr](https://streamr.network/discover/data-unions/) which suggest ways we might share and monetise our data on our own terms.

It might be a terrible idea. I don't know know enough to know yet. If you have civil, reasonable thoughts, chat to me on Twitter.

<IntroParagraph>

With the recent rise of <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, the idea of bi-directional linking is having a bit of a moment.

</IntroParagraph>

We're all very used to the _mono-directional_ link the World Wide Web is built around. They act as one-way pointers we follow in a linear sequence.

While we can link to any site, the destination page hasn't a clue we've done so.

We set up all these single direction paths, trying to signal relevance and context, only to have the other side completely ignore our efforts.

Our monolinks are trying to establish relationships in vain.

<BasicImage
    width="950px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1589455927/maggieappleton.com/notes/Hyperlinks.png"
/>

We're starting to look around our mono-linked environment, and wonder why it's so hard to surface relevant, contextual relationships.

Manually interlinking content takes an awful lot of human curation and effort. Effort we should probably slog off onto our systems.

> ✶ Enter the bi-directional link ✶

A _bi-directional_ link has **social awareness** - it knows about other pages or 'nodes' that point to it, and can make them visible to people. This means we get a two-way conversation flowing between our web locations.

<BasicImage
    width="950px"

/>

## Bi-directional links are not new

The idea of the bi-directional link goes all the way back to 1945, when [Vannevar Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush) dreamed up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Memex</a> machine.

Vannevar outlined this hypothetical gadget in an essay in _The Atlantic_ called <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a>. He wanted a system capable of "associative indexing... whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another... [so that] numerous items have been thus joined together to form a trail."

This essay turned out to be a foundational document for the ideologies that directly led to both the internet and the Web. <Footnote idName={1}>Yes, those are two entirely seperate pieces of technology.</Footnote> Vannevar was one of the key movers and shakers rallying folks to help build the original internet infrastructure. He coralled folks at MIT, the US Department of Defence, the National Science Foundation and various research labs like the Standford Lincoln Lab, Bell Labs, the RAND corporation, and Xerox PARC to get involved. <Footnote idName={2}>Walter Isaacson, <a href="https://www.librarything.com/work/15179823">The Innovators</a>: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution (London: Simon & Schuster, 2015).</Footnote>

Suffice to say, the guy was driven by a belief that enabling people to connect information and share knowledge would expand the scope of human understanding. The Memex was one idea of how that might manifest in material form.

<br />

<BasicImage
    showalt
    alt="Vannevar even created a small informative diagram of this desk-bound vision. Marketing chops 101."
    width="800px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_960/v1589545798/maggieappleton.com/notes/memex.jpg"
/>

Vannevar's evocative description of the Memex is especially impressive given that digital computers had only come into existence 5 years earlier. Most were still the domain of large military operations like Bletchley Park, and seen as inconveniently large calculators.

Implementing a wildly interactive computational personal knowledge base wasn't much of an option.

So the idea went into hiberation, and didn't resurface until the idea of personal computing began blooming in the sixties and seventies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted Nelson</a>, an unlikely film director and sociologist, stumbled into a series of computing lectures and began to imagine how graphical interfaces might reinvent the way we write and connect ideas. He took inspiration directly from Vannevar's essay, and in 1965 when he coined the term _hypertext_ to describe his vision for a sprawling network of interlinking information.

Nelson planned to implement these hypertextual dreams in his perpetually-imminent Project Xanadu. <Footnote idName={3}>If you have some time, this is quite the internet history <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">rabbit hole</a> to run down. <br /> Ted Nelson is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0NgV3yNd2o">another level</a>.</Footnote>

The Xanadu project was a hypertext system that imagined that every sentence, block, and page would be part of a vast bi-directionally linked network.

<br />

You'd be able to trace information back to its origin the way current web links do. But you'd also be able to see who had referenced, remixed, and expanded off that original. The full [[Pattern Language of Project Xanadu]] expands far beyond just bi-directional links to include features like [[Transclusions]], but we won't dive into it all here.

Suffice to say, Xanadu didn't pan out.

Instead we got the less fancy, but far more real and useable World Wide Web that currently does not support bi-directionals on an infrastructre level.

While Sir Tim Berner's Lee <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Topology.html">wrote himself a note</a> debating their pros and cons back in 1999, there is an obvious design issue with letting two-way connections flow freely around the web.

If _every_ site that linked to yours was visible on your page, and you had no control over who could and couldn't link to you, it is not hard to imagine the Trollish implications...

Figuring out how we might filter, moderate, and set permissions around link visibility turned into <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/74224.74236">quite the challenge</a>. The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/74224.74229">design details</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/74224.74245">grew complex</a>.

It became clear implementing the Web with simpler mono-directional links was the right thing to do, given that its creators wanted universal adoption. Lots of people are still mad about it. Let's not venture too far down that historical wormhole.

> **The TLDR is technology is hard**.

Until <a href="https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/">Xanadu ships</a> and we're all immersed in the universe of multi-linked, version-controlled nodes of remixable micro-content (that somehow solves the problems of permissions and moderation), there are still plenty of ways we can resurrect the possibility of bi-directional links on the web.

## Bi-direction Linking in Personal Digital Gardens

Most of the design issues with adding bi-directional links to the global web were related to moderation and permissions. However, adding them within the bounds of a single website with one author sidesteps that problem.

There's been a flurry of interest around bi-directionals among people involved in the [[Digital Gardening]] movement.

Much of this was originally sparked by <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/">Andy Matuschak's notes</a>. Go have a good browse through them.

<ImageFrame
    showalt
    alt="Andy's linked notes stack on top of one another, allowing you to browse to new notes while previous notes are still visible"
    width="1050px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_960/v1589545795/maggieappleton.com/notes/andy-note-links.png"
/>

<p>
    There's plenty to admire here.
    <Footnote idName={4}>
        It should be noted Andy is an experienced developer and interaction
        designer, and these notes should not be taken as the standard
        expectation for the rest of us normal plebby internet citizens.
    </Footnote> But the key part of this system that creates interlinked context
    is the <b>"Links to this Note"</b> section at the bottom of each post.{" "}
</p>

Anytime Andy links to another one of their notes on the site, it'll pop up as a related note at the bottom of the page. This is the bi-directional dream.

<BasicImage
    width="1050px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1589483829/maggieappleton.com/notes/Hyperlinks_3.png"
/>

It gives us a way to navigate through these ideas in exploratory mode, rather than navigating a hierarchy of categories on a main index page.

Since it's all contained within a single-author site, our Spammish-Troll-risk factor is at a comfortable zero.

### Building Your Own Bi-Directionals

That's all very cool, but how are you supposed to build bi-directionals into your own site? Thankfully, setting up your own public gardening bi-directional Memex doesn't involve Xanadu.

One fantastic option for non-developers is based around a personal wiki system called <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>. Anne-Laure Le Cunff wrote up an easy-to-follow guide to getting <a href="https://nesslabs.com/tiddlywiki-beginner-tutorial"> your own up and running</a>.

For those of us here for the hyper-customised, over-engineered Javascript solution (that would be me 🙌), the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby.js</a> community has a number of active gardening enthusiasts building themes and plugins.

I built mine using Aengus McMillin's <a href="https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/gatsby-theme-brain">gatsby-theme-brain</a>. Aengus has documented the theme well and it's not too challenging to implement (as long as you're comfortable in JavaScript and React).

I also curate a list of tools for [[Digital Gardening]] on this [Github repo](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners/)

---

### Bi-directional Linking with WebMentions

While I argued that Web-wide bi-directional links are unlikely to happen at a global scale, there's a way you can add bi-directionals to your personal website that picks up on references anywhere on the web.

[WebMentions](https://webmention.io/) are an piece of web infrastructre the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) community has done a lot of work to advocate for. The W3C gave the [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) _recommendation_ status in 2017.

The system notifies a URL whenever that site is mentioned elsewhere on the web. You're then able to show that mention and its contents on your site. It's essentially an opt-in bi-directional linking system.

Plenty of folks have written useful guides on how to add these to your site. Here's one for any [static site](https://keithjgrant.com/posts/2019/02/adding-webmention-support-to-a-static-site/), one for [Gatsby](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/building-gatsby-plugin-webmentions), one for [Next.js](https://css-tricks.com/jumping-into-webmentions-with-nextjs-or-not/). In fact there's a whole list of implementation examples on the [IndieWeb Wiki](https://indieweb.org/Webmention#IndieWeb_Examples) you can look through.

<span>
    This is mildly tangential, but I love how the topic of bi-directional links
    makes fully visible our "websites are locations" and "websites are
    containers" conceptual metaphors with <b>"inside"</b> and <b>"outside"</b>{" "}
    links.

<IntroParagraph>

Eight years ago, one of my undergraduate professors handed me the book [Addiction by Design](/addiction-by-design) by [Natasha Dow Schull](https://www.natashadowschull.org/). It's a gorgeous ethnographic tale of gambling machines and the people addicted to them.

<ResourceBook
    url="/addiction-by-design"

    title="Addiction By Design"

    author="Natasha Dow Schull"
    description="Addiction by Design takes readers into the intriguing world of machine gambling, an increasingly popular and absorbing form of play that blurs the line between human and machine, compulsion and control, risk and reward."
/>

It's more than a voyeuristic insight into people who sit at slot machines for 48 hours straight though. The garish floors of Las Vegas casinos become a venue to explore our embodied relationships with machines, the nature of technological dependence, and the potential hazards of mixing algorithmic systems with Capitalist incentives.

</IntroParagraph>

The book was my gateway drug into the field of **digital anthropology** (also known as _[cyborg anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg_anthropology)_ back then), as well as its sister discipline [Science and Technology Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_studies) (STS).

I fell for it hard. The way everyone falls for big, intoxicating ideas at twenty-one. Like Marxism or Foucauldian Power or Quantum String Theory. But unlike my other intellectual flings, this one stuck with me.

It let to a thesis on the [[Quantified Self]] movement, technological embodiment, and [Western Cosmology](/sadness-sweetness). I'm still exploring all the same research questions now, just through different means and ends.

After a few professional detours through illustration, web design, programming, and art direction, I'm circling back to my digital anthropology roots.

I've just ~~begun~~ (deferred until 2021) an MSc in Digital Anthropology at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/study/graduate-taught/digital-anthropology-msc).

Which means I'm being asked the question "so... what _is_ digital anthropology?" far more frequently.

## What is 'Anthropology'?

Forgive the obviousness of this, but like it says on the tin, it's the intersection of _cultural anthropology_ and _digital things_.

Let's break these two down, because they're both are open to generous interpretation.

<img
    alt="A venn diagram showing the intersection of anthropology and digital systems"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1602606477/maggieappleton.com/notes/digital-anth/whasdigitalanth.png"
/>

<br />

#### _Cultural anthropology_ is the study of human culture – our narratives, symbols, rituals, habits, beleifs and norms.

Or as [Clifford Geertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Geertz) put it, it's all the webs of meaning and significance we spin for ourselves <Footnote id={1}>If you'd like more insightful writings on the nature of culture, Geertz's [The Interpreation of Cultures](/interpretation-cultures) is an essential read</Footnote>.

That might sound pointlessly generic. Plenty of disciplines study culture – sociologists, historians, and economists among them.

What defines Anthropologists is that we study culture through **participant observation** <Footnote id={2}>Anthropologists use all manner of other methods too – surveys, data collection, interviews, mapping, and historical research. But active participant observation is at the heart of the discipline</Footnote>
– the act of completely immersing yourself in another culture for a long period of time as both an active _participant_ in it, and _an observer_ of it. You join in the dance, and then analyse what the dance means.

Essentially, we study culture at an "on the ground" level – looking for the individual stories, rich details, particular nuances, and [thick description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thick_description) you can only find by spending extended time with people in their daily lives.  
As opposed to pointing a telescope at them from afar, bringing them into labs to run hypothetical experiments, or amassing troves of personal data and analysing it for the 'big trends'.

If you want to know more about Anthropology, I can enthusiastically recommend Tim Ingold's short but beautiful introduction [Anthropology: Why It Matters](/anthropology-matters).

---

#### By _digital things_ I mean objects and systems based on binary logic – the 1's and 0's that run all of modern computing.

Given that _digital_ systems are now pervasive across human societies and take on a million manifestations, it feels a bit trite to try and define it. But this description fits quite well.

It comes from Miller & Horst's essential introduction _[The Digital and the Human](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/people/academic-and-teaching-staff/daniel-miller/digital-and-human-prospectus-digital-anthropology-1):
A Prospectus for Digital Anthropology_

Binary code enables us to simplify information down into single bytes that can be easily stored, copied, manipulated, and sent through fibre optic cables at warp speed. It's what makes all modern communication technologies possible. It's also a sufficient catch-all category for the kinds of things Digital Anthropologists study.

We're into algorithms, data, anything to do with the internet, robotics, programming, virtual currencies, the gig economy, wearable devices, ubiquitous computing, and yes, weird subcultures in the dark corners of 4chan.

Or more specifically, we're interested in understanding the cultural _symbolism, narratives, beliefs, rituals, taboos, economics, power dynamics, and daily practices_ around those things.

This is a long, overdue case study showing how I make an [egghead](https://egghead.io/) course illustration.

It spans everything from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor">cognitive metaphor theory</a> to Photoshop rendering so I hope you have a hot, caffeinated beverage with you.

<br />

<Center>It also comes in four parts</Center>

<MultipartIntro />

## An Introduction

For the last half decade I've been the art director & lead illustrator over at <a href="https://egghead.io">egghead</a>.

We're a company / website / collection of humans who teach web development. We use a mix of tutorial videos, code challenges, articles, illustrated notes, workshops, and whatever other medium we feel like.
As you might expect, it's a whole lot of JavaScript, React, GraphQL, Vue, classic HTML & CSS, and other internety technologies.

It's my job to take all those abstract, hard-to-explain programming concepts, and make them visible in a way that helps people understand. Sometimes through illustrations, or animations, or illustrated notes, or diagrams, or interpretive dance on zoom calls.

One part of that is making _**course illustrations**_, which are like album cover art for all the courses we publish.

<Center>Here's a few of them...</Center>

So far I've made over 150 of these things, and I'm almost beginning to think I know what I'm doing. <Footnote idName={1}>I don't make all of our illustrations – I work with a rotating team of freelancers who help with the load.

## Part Zero – What are we doing?

The guinea pig for this case study is going to be <a href="https://twitter.com/mikesherov">Mike Sherov</a>'s course on <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/web-security-essentials?af=54fd64">Web Security Essentials</a>.

Here's a quick overview of the course – it shows you how to protect a website against common attacks like man-in-the-middle interceptions, cross-site scripting, and cookie hijacking. All your classic internet foes.

The first step in starting a design task of any kind – illustration, innovative sandwich recipe, or carbon capture technology – is making the challenge you're facing nice and clear. So let's write ourselves a challenge statement:

> Create an illustration that clearly communicates the idea of "Web Security"

That might seem dumb and obvious, but it's surprising how easy it is to get off track without stating the goal up front.

At this point, it's good to make clear that _"Web Security"_ is not a single, physical, made-of-atoms-and-quarks object in the world.

Thus begins our problem.

### How do you draw a thing that's not a thing?

It's a good question.
One I'm slightly obsessed with.

Drawing well is difficult in its own right. Making a dog look like a dog or hand look like a hand requires a lot of training, practice and patience.
It's a whole extra challenge to figure out what the _thing_ you're going to draw is in the first place.

How do you take a fuzzy-edged, evolving cultural concept like "Web Security," and condense it down to a single image?

The answer, in short, is a mix of **cultural symbols** and **visual metaphor**. Though there's a little more to it than that.

Good, meaningful illustration works in four layers.  
I like to think of it as a cake:

<BasicImage
    width="850px"
    alt="Illustration of a layered cake with four tiers. The bottom is meaningful visual metaphor, next is clear, well constructed drawing, third is a nicely designed composition, and the top is fancy lighting and pretty colors. On top of the cake is cream and a cherry representing whichever app or brush I'm using"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1632316505/maggieappleton.com/essays/drawing-invisibles/Illustration_Cake800_2x_shrink_kbmoiz.png"
/>

You start with a solid base of visual metaphor. Add on a layer of clear, well-constructed drawing. Then you think about designing an aesthetically pleasing composition with <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/design-principles-visual-perception-and-the-principles-of-gestalt/">gestalt principals</a>. And finally you throw fancy lighting and pretty colors over the top. <Footnote idName={2}>Not an official theory of any sort - just IMHO. Feel free to email this to real illustration professors and PhD students so they can burn it on the sacrificial cross of correctness'</Footnote>

### Tool Talk

A whole lot of people ask about the whipped cream and cherries sitting at the very top of that cake.

> "What app is that?"

This happens in every industry – the most visible top layer of any creation feels like the most important part of it. Asking what tool someone uses is a very logical and legitimate question.

So let's get the tool talk out of the way. I've written a [whole post](apps)talking about the hardware/software I use for various illustration styles. But here's the quick version:

<BasicImage
    width="840px"
    alt="Photos of a macbook pro, a cintiq drawing tablet, an ipad pro, and the app logos for procreate, illustrator, and photoshop"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1632316506/maggieappleton.com/essays/drawing-invisibles/Techtools_shrink_siqptv.png"
/>

I do all my brainstorming and sketching in <a href="https://procreate.art/">Procreate</a> on an iPad Pro 12.5"
Once I'm ready to make the final, I use a combination of Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. My main machine is a Macbook Pro 2015. It's hooked up to a <a href="https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-displays/cintiq-22-hd">Wacom Cintiq 22HD</a> monitor that allows me to hand-paint in details.

These tools are certainly an integral part of making shit look cool (and I am **_very_** into making shit look cool). There's inherent power in crafting precise shapes in Illustrator. Painting subtle lighting effects with blending layers in Photoshop is a joy. I don't want to disregard the technical side.

But for most of this blog post I'm not going to focus on it. I'm not convinced telling you what pixel size I set my #EAEFF1 brush to while I careful render diffuse light across a reflective metallic surface like a pedantic perfectionist is helpful. <Footnote idName={3}>If you would like to learn how to do the shiny lighting stuff, take Sam Neilson's <a href="https://www.schoolism.com/school.php?id=3">Fundamentals of Lighting</a> on Schoolism. It will drown you in the minutiae of rendering light on surfaces.<br />Also check out the <a href="/resources">Resources</a> page.</Footnote>

I will cover that workflow more in Part 4 of this series. But they're not _The Thing We're Doing_. Which is learning how to draw invisible things. So let's get back to talking about the meaty stuff.

---

## Part One - Making Metaphors

Let's start at the bottom of the cake with _Metaphors_.  
 Metaphors are fundamental to how we visualise anything that's a non-physical, abstract **idea**.

Drawing an orange is fairly straight forward. Drawing freedom, financial crashes, racial tension, teamwork, speculation, database management, capitalism, or productivity all relies on metaphor.

### So, what's a Metaphor?

The first step to getting good at metaphor is understanding what it is.  
Let's make sure we're all on the same page:

> A metaphor is when we understand one thing in terms of another.

The power of metaphor is it helps us use something we _know_ to understand something we _don't know_.

<BasicImage
    width="940px"
    alt="Diagram of thing A projecting onto thing B"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1632316507/maggieappleton.com/essays/drawing-invisibles/mapping_shrink_hylcer.png"
/>

We may not 100% understand Thing B. But we know enough about Thing A, and can **map** its qualities onto Thing B. Which at least gives us a starting point.

I can tell you <a href="https://www.wired.com/video/watch/5-levels-4">a quantum computing bit is like a spinning coin</a> that is neither nor heads or tails, but kind of both. And now you're 1% closer to understanding how a quantum computer works.

Sometimes we actually know a lot about Thing B, but thinking about it in terms of Thing A gives us insights we never realised before.

In metaphor nerd terms we call Thing A the **source** and Thing B the **target**. The source is like a _frame_ that we look at the target object through.

It "frames" how we see Thing B.

<BasicImage
    width="880px"
    alt="Diagram of the source frame and the target object"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1632316505/maggieappleton.com/essays/drawing-invisibles/frame_shrink_irt2qv.png"
/>

Just like a window frame, the **source** frame gives us a limited view of the world. Anything outside the frame get _hidden_, while anything within the frame gets _highlighted_.

<BasicImage
    width="940px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1632316505/maggieappleton.com/essays/drawing-invisibles/hide-highlight_shrink_ljkonq.png"
    alt="Diagram of highlighting and hiding"
/>

Qualities that both the source and target share are _highlighted_. While qualities they don't share are _hidden_ away outside the frame.

Let's look at an example of this in action.  
We often talk about **time** through the metaphorical frame of **money**.

> That delayed flight _cost_ me an hour.  
> Can I _steal_ a few minutes of your time?  
> I don't know if _spending_ all day on that is _worth_ my while.

The way we speak about time shows we project the qualities of money onto our idea of time.

<BasicImage
    width="940px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1632316506/maggieappleton.com/essays/drawing-invisibles/timeismoney_shrink_n2s9h4.png"
    alt="Time is money image"
/>

Our _Time is Money_ metaphor highlights the qualities of time that overlap with money:

-   Time is a quantifiable substance we can count
-   Time is a valuable, limited resource
-   Time is a something we can give to, and take from other people

There are plenty of time's qualities hidden by the frame of money. Unlike money, we all experience time as a relative, amorphous flow. It shifts form and length based on where we are, who we're with, what we're doing. One minute in a freezing cold shower does not feel the same one minute in the midst of a deep Netflix binge. One minute is not one minute in the same way one pound is one pound. <Footnote idName={4}>Our metaphors are also deeply cultural, rather than being "natural" or "inherent." They emerge in particular historical times and places, and serve particular purposes and particular people. <br /><br /> There are plenty of cultures where time isn't thought of in this kind of rigid, segmented, and quantifable way. It's firmly rooted in the historical context of a Western, post-Enlightenment, Capitalist society.</Footnote>

Money isn't the only metaphor for time. We also compare it to a moving object when we say _"that hour flew by,"_ or a container when we say _"tomorrow is pretty full."_
We're perfectly capable of using multiple, overlapping metaphors for a single concept. And we're able to switch between them without confusing ourselves. Very handy.

> Which metaphor we pick depends on what qualities we want to highlight or hide. We focus us on what's _important_ about the target, and downplay irrelevant details.

This is why metaphors are so good at explaining complex ideas. We get fine-grained control over what's most important about the concept, and cut out all the noise.

Beyond just being useful for learning complex concepts, and framing old ideas in new ways, metaphor is the basis of nearly every thought we have. It's a fundamental building block of human cognition that shapes the way we percieve and interact with the world. <Footnote idName={5}>This goes a bit too deep to elaborate on here, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_metaphor">Cognitive Metaphor Theory</a> is beautifully mind-blowing and worth exploring when you have time. A good starting point is the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By">Metaphors We Live By</a> written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff">George Lakoff</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Johnson_(philosopher)">Mark Johnson</a>. TLDR, they're more important than you think.</Footnote>

### Programming the Metaphors

Metaphorical thinking is _especially_ useful when we're trying to explain and illustrate programming concepts.

The kind of topics we teach at egghead are _always_:  
a) fundamentally abstract  
b) haven't been around long enough for our culture to develop a set of meaningful icons and visual symbols for them

Try, for a moment to imagine what "<a href="https://egghead.io/courses/use-typescript-to-develop-react-applications">Typescript with React</a>" visually looks like. Or "<a href="https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-server-rendered-reactjs-application-with-next-js">A Server-rendered ReactJS Application with Next.js</a>". Or the "<a href="https://egghead.io/courses/state-monad-in-javascript">State Monad in JavaScript</a>"

Not exactly a vivid picture in your mind, right?

This is partly because programming is an abstract activity. It has to be.  
Taken literally, programming involves running enormously complex sequences of electrical currents. On a microscopic scale. Inside our machines.  
That world isn't human friendly. We can't see what's going on or control what happens without a thick layer of symbolic software in the middle.

So we invented programming languages.  
The JavaScript snippet `let fruit = banana` _maps onto_ a specific set of electrical pulses firing deep inside your hardware.

In programmer land this is called an _abstraction_.

Funnily enough, it also fits our definition of a metaphor. _Programming is just a giant stack of metaphors._ Each layer of the metaphorical stack moves us further away from machine world, and closer to human world. <Footnote idName={6}>Here's a terribly nerdy MIT PhD thesis about it if you want to go down the rabbit hole... <a href="http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~mt/thesis/mt-thesis.html">Programming with Agents:</a><i> New metaphors for thinking about computation</i></Footnote>

Illustrated metaphors that capture the main idea of a programming concept are just one more addition to the top of our human-friendly stack.

### Learning to Metaphorically See

Now that you're thoroughly soaked in trippy metaphor theory, let's bring it back down to earth with some familiar examples.

One way to hone your metaphor-making skills is to explicitly notice when you're seeing one. We process metaphors automatically and unconsciously. Which means it takes a little effort to consciously understand how they work.

Let's take another look at some of these course illustrations, and work backwards to break down each piece of the metaphor.

I know this is a little like telling a joke, and then explaining why the joke was funny. It kind of sucks the fun out of it.  
But breaking down visual metaphors helps train your mind to consciously see how they're built. You stop operating on autopilot, and understand there's a logical process in moving from abstract idea to concrete visual.

I keep a giant collection of these for reference. Every time I spot a terribly clever editorial illustration or advertisement, it goes in the file.  
Two illustrators I consider the cream of the metaphorical crop are <a href="https://www.emilianoponzi.com/">Emiliano Ponzi</a> and <a href="https://chasematt.com/">Matt Chase</a>. Take a look at a few of their creations:

Knowing how to build a good metaphor isn't only useful for illustration.  
Metaphors come in many forms. You can write metaphors into tutorials and documentation. You can explain a piece of technology to a non-technical co-worker. Or you can finally find a meaningful way to tell your mother what you actually do for work (other than "computers").

In Part Two I'll dive into more specific techniques for creating metaphors.  
We'll cover how to do cultural and linguistic research to find existing metaphors. We'll also work through building new metaphors by focusing on core qualities of a concept, and using lateral thinking to generate alternative solutions.

<IntroParagraph>

In the story of Echo and Narcissus, a chatty mountain nymph and a self-obsessed hunter both die from unhealthy obsessions. Echo won't shut up, annoys the wrong goddess, and ends up cursed to repeat the words of others; she's unable to say anything original. She then falls in love with Narcissus, a pretty boy who spends his whole day staring at his reflection and is wholly unimpressed with the woman repeating everything he says. In the end, they both spend so much time staring at Narcissus they forget to eat, bathe, or sleep and slowly waste away.

</IntroParagraph>

This delightful story is a good reminder to eat regular snacks. It's also a fitting metaphor for one of the clubs I run at [Hyperlink Academy](https://hyperlink.academy/)

The [_Echo & Narcissus Writing Club_](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/echo-and-narcissus-writing-club/118) is all about mimicking the work of exceptional writers in order to learn from them.

This might sound scandalous depending on your understanding of creativity. I'm personally a subscriber to the [everything is a remix](https://vimeo.com/14912890) and [great artists steal](https://austinkleon.com/steal/) schools of thought.

I used to think copying was unseemly before one of my writing professors in college filled me in on the big, unkept secret. He handed us a small trove of writing samples from folks like [Joan Didion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Didion), [John McPhee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McPhee), [Barbara Kingsolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Kingsolver), and [Ernest Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway). Essentially a Who's Who of New Yorker essayists. We had to copy out their work, then write our own pieces using the copied sentences as 'templates.'

You would take a Didion sentence like '_Only the very young and the very old may recount their dreams at breakfast, dwell upon self, interrupt with memories of beach picnics and favorite Liberty lawn dresses and the rainbow trout in a creek near Colorado Springs_,' and learn how to see it as "Only the **\_\_\_\_** and the **\_\_\_\_** may **\_\_\_\_**, **\_\_\_\_**, **\_\_\_\_** and **\_\_\_\_**." A reusable format for pointing out similarities between two distinct things.

The point is not to rip off Didion, but to begin to see how she uses nouns. Where she places verbs. How she handles semi-colons. Where she begins a story and where she ends it. How she asks a question. How she makes you doubt her credibility as a narrator.

Copying forces you to look at writing techniques under a microscope. You stop seeing your favourite authors as magical beings who pump out great work from behind a veil. Everything you need to know about their process and how to write like them is already on the page in front of you.

Great writers become great by closely studying and copying other great writers.
This is how cultural knowledge works. We learn the foundational skills from each other first, and then get all weird and experimental later on once the normal rules become boring.

<Halfspacer />

## Who This is For and What to Expect

If you have a writing practice of any kind, and feel the urge to improve it, this club is for you. You will need to bring along a Narcissus - a writer whose work you love and want to emulate. If you are bad at making choices, you can bring along two.

We keep it casual - the weekly meetings are to chat, compare what we've learned, and give each other feedback in pairs. There won't be lectures or lots of instruction. As a peer learning group, it's simply a way to gather together and support each other on our journey to being less-crap-writers.

It will require a commitment to write. The writing doesn't have to be good or profound or SEO-optimised. It simply needs to try and copy the style of your Narcissus.
We'll write 500 word pieces for the first 4 weeks, and 1000+ words in the final week.

It runs for **6 weeks** and **costs 35 USD**. I find a little skin in the game helps everyone show up on time. Committed folks make the experience better for everyone.

---

## Cohort 1

The first cohort of this club ran from **May 1st** to **June 6th 2021**.

We ended up with a wonderfully committed and insightful group of folks – something you don't always bank on with online learning groups.

Everyone came in with an active writing practice which I think made a significant difference. They already made time to write; publishing to personal blogs, newsletters, or ongoing fiction collections. The club simply directed that writing effort toward certain themes and assignments.

<!-- #### What We Wrote

The 500-word weekly assignments lead to some great short pieces. Lots of these were beginnings or experiments – a first pass at an idea, the start of a chapter, a lead in to a longer piece of research. Here's a selection of them:
- [The Ancestral Hall of Side Projects](https://www.jonathanyeong.com/garden/the-ancestral-hall-of-side-projects) by Jonathan Yeong
- [Coming to America - Robbed](https://adagia.org/content/1668) by Keni -->

<Halfspacer />

#### Club Logistics

I wanted to run the club in a space where we could take open-ended notes, write individual essays, and leave comments on each other's work. I ended up using [Notion](https://notion.so) which worked great – it became the organising spot for agendas, weekly assignments, resources, and casual chatter:

<ImageFrame
    width="1000px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1200/v1623137511/maggieappleton.com/notes/echo-narcissus/The_Echo_Narcissus_Writing_Club_shrink_yfymsh.png"
    alt="Screencapture of our Notion space listing weekly themes and links to other pages"
/>

We all posted our weekly writing to a central database in here. I then used Notion's fancy [linked databases and filtering](https://www.notion.so/Linked-databases-fb007e2798d04c57aee839ecf6ce450a) features to have the right assignments show up in each week's agenda. This made it easy to see everyone compiling notes, analysing texts, and writing over the course of the week.

Here's an example of what each weekly agenda looked like:

    alt="The agenda, writing pieces, and homework assignment for week 4 of the club"
/>

Notion worked great for this round. For future cohorts I might try running it on the new platform Hyperlink is building (aptly named _Hyperspace_) which is based around wiki-like shared documents.

If you're interested in joining a future cohort, you can sign up to be notified on the [Hyperlink club page](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/echo-and-narcissus-writing-club/118).

<IntroParagraph>

Back in April of 2020 I put up a long twitter thread on the emerging trend of **Digital Gardening**. It gathered a little buzz, and made clear we're in a moment where there is something culturally compelling about this concept.

</IntroParagraph>

<TweetEmbed tweetId="1250532315459194880" />

My [small collection](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880) highlighted a number of sites that are taking a new approach to the way we publish personal knowledge on the web.

They're not following the conventions of the "_personal blog_," as we've come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.

A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

<BasicImage
    width="1000px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1000/v1616170717/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/growth-leaves_gtdalf.png"
/>

It harkens back to the early days of the web when people had fewer notions of how websites "_should be_." It's an ethos that is both classically old and newly imagined.

# A Brief History of Digital Gardens

Let's go on a short journey to the origin of this word. The notion of a _digital garden_ is not a 2020 invention. It's been floating around for over two decades. However, it's passed through a couple of semantic shifts in that time, meaning different things to different people across the years. As words tend to do.

Tracing back how [[Neologisms]] are born helps us understand why anyone needed this word in the first place. Language is always a response to the evolving world around us – we expand it when our current vocabulary fails to capture what we're observing, or have a particular desire for how we'd like the future to unfold. Naming is a political act as much as a poetic one.

## The Early Gardens of Hypertext

Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html">Hypertext Gardens</a> appears to be the first recorded mention of the term. Mark was part of the early hypertext crowd – the developers figuring out how to arrange and present this new medium.

While the essay is a beautiful ode to free-wheeling internet exploration, it's less about building personal internet spaces, and more of a manifesto on user experience flows and content organisation.

<Subtext>Let's note that Mark's graphics are to die for</Subtext>

To put this in its historical context, Mark's writing was part of a larger conversation happening throughout the nineties around hypertext and its metaphorical framing.

The early web-adopters were caught up in the idea of The Web as a labyrinth-esque community landscape tended by <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGardener">WikiGardeners</a> and <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGnome">WikiGnomes.</a><Footnote idName={1}>The caretaking roles given to people who cleaned up broken links, attributions, and awkward white space on shared wiki websites.</Footnote>
These creators wanted to enable pick-your-own-path experiences, while also providing enough signposts that people didn't feel lost in their new, strange medium.

The early web debates around this became known as <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-55991-4_31">_The Navigation Problem_</a> – the issue of how to give web users just enough guidance to freely explore the web, without forcing them into pre-defined browsing experiences. The eternal struggle to find the right balance of chaos and structure.

> "Unplanned hypertext sprawl is wilderness: complex and interesting, but uninviting. Interesting things await us in the thickets, but we may be reluctant to plough through the brush, subject to thorns and mosquitoes"

While Mark's essay was concerned with different problems to the ones we face on the web today, its core ethos feels aligned with our emerging understanding of digital gardening. It captures the desire for exploratory experiences, a welcoming of digital weirdness, and a healthy amount of resistance to top-down structures.

After Mark's essay the term **digital gardening** goes quiet for nearly a decade.

## Digital Puttering on Twitter

In April of 2007 when Tweets first started ringing through the internet airwaves, Rory Sutherland (oddly, the vice president of Ogilvy Group) used the term "**digital gardening**", but defined it as _"faffing about syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people"_ <Footnote idName={2}>For those from outside the Commonwealth, "faffing" means mucking about without a clear direction or useful output</Footnote>

<TweetEmbed tweetId="34981652" />

The next dozen mentions on Twitter all followed this sentiment – people were using the term as a way to describe **digital maintenance** - **the act of cleaning up one's digital space**. The focus was on sorting, weeding, pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating. People mentioned cleaning out private folders, codebases, and photo albums as the focus of their gardening efforts.

These people were **digital puttering** more than gardening.

<TweetEmbed tweetId="1616935301" />

<TweetEmbed tweetId="10102084267" />

<TweetEmbed tweetId="40614201554640896" />

Since none of these folks reference to the earlier nineties notion of **digital gardening**, or mention issues of hypertext navigation, this use of the word feels like a brief tangent. Given the tiny size of Twitter in the early days, these people probably belonged to the same social flocks and were riffing off one another. It's not necessarily part of the mainstream narrative we're tracking, but shows there's not one strict meaning to the term.

That said, some degree of faffing about, sorting, and pruning are certainly part of the practice of digital gardening. Though best enjoyed in moderation.

## Gardens, Streams, and Caufield's Metaphors

At the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivered a keynote on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY&feature=emb_logo">The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral</a>. It later becomes <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">a hefty essay</a> that lays the foundations for our current understanding of the term. **If anyone should be considered the original source of _digital gardening_, it's Caufield.** They are the first to lay out this whole idea in poetic, coherent words.

Caufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools – it's not a Wordpress plugin, Gastby theme, or Jekyll template. It's a **different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information** - one that accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable space.

<TwoColumn>

<div>

Caufield's main argument was that we have become swept away by _streams_ – the collapse of information into single-track timelines of events. The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and InstaTwitBook is fleeting – they're only concerned with self-assertive immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments. <Footnote idName={3}>While this may sound obvious now, the streamification of everything was still dawning around 2015.</Footnote>

This is not inherently bad. Streams have their time and place. Twitter is a force-multiplier for exploratory thoughts and delightful encounters once you fall in with the right crowd and learn to play the game.

But streams only surface the Zetigeisty ideas of the last 24 hours. They are not designed to accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information, or mature over time. <Footnote idName={4}>Though the rising popularity of <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/01/spreading-threading/">Twitter threading</a> is an impressive attempt to reconfigure a stream environment and make it more garden-esque.</Footnote>

The _garden_ is our counterbalance. **Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time.** Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore. Think about the way Wikipedia works when you're hopping from [Bolshevism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevism) to [Celestial Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_mechanics) to [Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number). It's hyperlinking at it's best. You get to actively choose which curiosity trail to follow, rather than defaulting to the algorithmically-filtered ephemeral stream. **The garden helps us move away from time-bound streams and into contextual knowledge spaces.**

> "The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another."

### Carrying on Caufield

Good ideas take time to germinate, and Caufield's vision of the personal garden didn't reach critical mass right off the bat. It lay dormant, waiting for the right time and the right people to find it.

In late 2018 the corner of Twitter I hang out in began using the term more regularly – folks began passing around Caufield's original article and experimenting with ways to turn their chronological blogs into exploratory, interlinked gardens.

Tom Critchlow's 2018 article [Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) was one of the main kick-off points. Tom read Caufield's essay and began speculating on alternative metaphors to frame the way we consume and produce information. They suggested we add _campfires_ to the idea of streams and gardens – the private Slack groups, casual blog rings, and [[Cozy Web]] areas where people write in response to one another. While gardens present the ideas of an individual, campfires are conversational spaces to exchange ideas that aren't yet fully formed.

Tom piece was shortly followed by Joel Hooks' [My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) in early 2019. <Footnote idName={5}>Disclaimer that Joel is a mentor, collaborator and friend, so my exposure to the idea comes from his early advocacy and enthusiasm for it.</Footnote> Joel focused on the _process_ of digital gardening, emphasising the slow growth of ideas through writing, rewriting, editing, and revising thoughts in public. Instead of slapping Fully Formed Opinions up on the web and never changing them.

Joel also added Amy Hoy's [How the Blog Broke the Web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/) post to the pile of influential ideas that led to our current gardening infatuation. While not specifically about gardening, Amy's piece gives us a lot of good historical context. In it, she explores the history of blogs over the last three decades, and pinpoints exactly when we all became fixated on publishing our thoughts in reverse chronological order (spoiler: around 2001 with the launch of [Moveable Type](https://www.movabletype.org/)).

Amy argues that Moveable Type didn't just launch us into the "**Chronological Sort Era**". It also killed the wild, diverse, hodge-podge personalisation of websites that characterised the early web. Instead of hand-coding your own layout and deciding exactly how to arrange the digital furniture, we began to enter the age of standardised layouts. Plug n' play templates that you drop content into became the norm. It became harder and more technically involved to edit the HTML & CSS yourself.

> "Suddenly people weren’t creating homepages or even web pages... they were writing web content in form fields and text areas inside a web page."

Many people have lamented the web's slow transition from unique homepages to a bland ocean of generic Wordpress themes. Digital gardening is part of the pushback against the limited range of vanilla web formats and layouts we now for granted.

Over the course 2019 and early 2020, more and more people began riffing on the concept. Shaun Wang compiled the [Digital Gardening Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos/). Anne-Laure Le Cunff published a popular guide to setting up [No-code Digital Gardens](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up). The IndieWeb community hosted a [pop-up session](https://indieweb.org/2020/Pop-ups/GardenAndStream) to discuss the history of commonplace books, personal wikis, and memory palaces.

By late 2020 this whole concept had attracted enough attention for the MIT Tech Review to write [a short piece](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/) on it. Perhaps this is the watershed moment when a Twitter buzzword has "made it."

## Digital Gardening's Fertile Soil

What made our current historical moment the right time for digital gardening to take off?

The timing coincided with a few complimentary ideas and communities rallying around personal knowledge systems, note-taking practices, and reimagining tools for blogging. The scene was ripe for new ideas around curating and sharing personal knowledge online.

Many of the people who jumped on the early digital gardening bandwagon were part of communities like...

-   The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) collective – a group that has been championing independent web spaces outside the walled gardens of Instatwitbook for nearly a decade.
-   Users of the note-taking app [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) – Roam pioneered new ways of interlinking content and strongly appeals to people trying to build sprawling knowledge graphs.
-   Followers of Tiago Forte's [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) course which popularised the idea of actively curating personal knowledge.
-   People rallying around the [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) ethos that encourages continuously creating 'learning exhaust' in the form of notes and summaries.

### Developer-led Gardening

Many of these early adopters were people who understood how to build websites – either professional developers or enthusiastic hobbyists. Any kind of novel experimentation with the web requires knowing a non-trivial amount of HTML, CSS, and JS. Not to mention all the surrounding infrastructure required actually to get a site live. Developers took to the idea because they already had the technical ability to jump in play around with what garden-esque websites might look like.

The current state of web development helped here too. While it feels like we've been in a slow descent into a horrifyingly complex and bloated web development process, a number of recent tools have made it easier to get a fully customised website up and running. Services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) have taken the pain out of deployment. Static site generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/), [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Next](https://nextjs.org/) make it easier to build sophisticated websites that auto-generate pages, and take care of grunt work like optimising load time, images, and SEO. <Footnote idName={6}>Plenty of people will disagree that this explosion of JavaScript-stuffed rubbish is a net gain for the web. We all lament the loss of being able to upload pure HTML and CSS files via FTP. But those days are gone, and the only thing we can do now is slowly untangle our JavaScript spaghetti and package it up into more accessible build tools.</Footnote> These services are trying to find a happy middle ground between tediously hand-coding solutions, and being trapped in the restrictions of Wordpress or Squarespace.

While developers were the first on the scene, plenty of writers, researchers, and note-taking enthusiasts have been drawn to the idea of digital gardening.
To help folks without programming skills join in, there's been a surge in templates and platforms that allow people to build their own digital gardens without touching a ton of code. I've written an entire guide to [[Digital Gardening for Non-Technical Folks]] if you fall into that category.

Tools like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/), and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) are all great options. Many of them offer fancy features like nested folders, [[Bi-Directional Links]], footnotes, and visual graphs.

However, many of these no-code tools still feel like cookie-cutter solutions. Rather than allowing people to design the [information architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture) and spatial layouts of their gardens, they inevitably force people into pre-made arrangements. This doesn't meant they don't "count," as "real" gardens, but simply that they limit their gardeners to some extent. You can't design different types of links, novel features, experimental layouts, or custom architecture. They're pre-fab houses instead of raw building materials.

## The Six Patterns of Gardening

In all the recent gardening flurry, we've run into the inevitable confusion around how to define the term.

<TweetEmbed tweetId="1260368292851535879" />

There are contested ideas about what qualifies as a garden, what the core ethos should focus on, and whether it's worthy of a new label at all. What exactly makes a website a _digital garden_ as opposed to just another blog?

After reading all the existing takes on the term, observing a wide variety of gardens, and collecting some of the [best examples](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), I've identified a few key qualities they all share.

There are a few guiding principles, design patterns and structures people are rallying around. This amounts to a kind of digital gardening [[Pattern Language]].

<Halfspacer />

### 1. Topography over Timelines

Gardens are organised around **contextual relationships and associative links**; the concepts and themes within each note determine how it's connected to others.

This runs counter to the time-based structure of traditional blogs: posts presented in reverse chronological order based on publication date.

Gardens don't consider publication dates the most important detail of a piece of writing. Dates might be included on posts, but they aren't the structural basis of how you navigate around the garden. Posts are connected to other by posts through related themes, topics, and shared context.

One of the best ways to do this is through [[Bi-directional Links]] – links that make both the destination page and the source page visible to the reader. This makes it easy to move between related content.

<BasicImage
    width="900px"
    alt="A linear timeline of posts vs. a spatial layout of connected posts"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621774501/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/topographytimelines_shrink_jxgw9l.png"
/>

Because garden notes are densely linked, a garden explorer can enter at any location and follow any trail they link through the content, rather than being dumped into a "most recent" feed.

Dense links are essential, but gardeners often layer on other ways of exploring their knowledge base. They might have [thematic piles](https://busterbenson.com/piles/), [nested folders](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/), tags and filtering functionality, [advanced search bars](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/garden), [visual node graphs](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/), or [central indexes](https://www.gwern.net/index) listing notable and popular content.

Many entry points but no prescribed pathways.

<Spacer />

### 2. Continuous Growth

Gardens are never finished, they're **constantly growing, evolving, and changing**. Just like a real soil, carrot, and cabbage garden.

The isn't how we usually think about writing on the web. Over the last decade, we've moved away from casual live journal entries and formalised our writing into _articles_ and _essays_. These are carefully crafted, edited, revised, and published with a timestamp. When it's done, it's done. We act like tiny magazines, sending our writing off to the printer.

This is odd considering editability is one of the main selling points of the web. Gardens lean into this – there is no "final version" on a garden. What you publish is always open to revision and expansion. <Footnote idName={7}>Or more likely, contraction and clarification</Footnote>

Gardens are designed to evolve alongside your thoughts. When you first have an idea, it's fuzzy and unrefined. You might notice a pattern in your corner of the world, but need to collect evidence, consider counter-arguments, spot similar trends, and research who else has thunk such thoughts before you. In short, you need to do your homework and critically think about it over time.

<BasicImage
    width="950px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621773885/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/gardentime_rrsecv.png"
    alt="A graph of time versus amount of work. Gardening involves small amounts of work over time, while classic blogging involves a lot of work all at once."
/>

In performance-blog-land you do that thinking and researching privately, then shove it out at the final moment. A grand flourish that hides the process.

In garden-land, that process of researching and refining happens on the open internet. You post ideas while they're still "seedlings," and tend them regularly until they're fully grown, respectable opinions.

This has a number of benefits:

-   You're freed from the pressure to get everything right immediately. You can test ideas, get feedback, and revise your opinions like a good internet citizen.
-   It's _low friction_. Gardening your thoughts becomes a daily ritual that only takes a small amount of effort. Over time, big things grow.
-   It gives readers an insight into your writing and thinking process. They come to realise you are not a magical idea machine banging out perfectly formed thoughts, but instead an equally mediocre human doing The Work of trying to understand the world and make sense of it alongside you.

This all comes with an important caveat; **gardens make their imperfection known to readers**. Which brings us to the next pattern...

<Spacer />

### 3. Imperfection & Learning in Public

Gardens are **imperfect by design**. They don't hide their rough edges or claim to be a permanent source of truth.

Putting anything imperfect and half-written on an "official website" may feel strange. <Footnote idName={8}>We seem to reserve all our imperfect declarations and poorly-worded announcements for platforms that other people own and control.</Footnote> We have all been trained to behave like tiny, performative corporations when it comes to presenting ourselves in digital space. Blogging evolved in the [Premium Mediocre](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/) culture of Millenialism as a way to Promote Your Personal Brand™ and market your SEO-optimized Content.

Weird, quirky personal blogs of the early 2000's turned into cleanly crafted brands with publishing strategies and media campaigns. Everyone now has a modern minimalist logo and an LLC.

Digital gardening is the [Domestic Cozy](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/series/domestic-cozy/) response to the professional personal blog; it's both intimate and public, weird and welcoming. It's less performative than a blog, but more intentional and thoughtful than a Twitter feed. It wants to build personal knowledge over time, rather than engage in banter and quippy conversations.

Think of it as a spectrum. Things we dump into private WhatsApp group chats, DMs, and cavalier Tweet threads are part of our _chaos streams_ - a continuous flow of high noise / low signal ideas. On the other end we have highly performative and cultivated artefacts like published books that you prune and tend for years.

Gardening sits in the middle. It's the perfect balance of chaos and cultivation.

<BasicImage
    width="1000px"
    alt="a spectrum of knowledge management, ranging from chaos streams to the cultivated performance of publishing a book. Gardening sits in the middle."
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_1600/v1593765637/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/digital-garden.png"
/>

This ethos of imperfection opens up a world of possibility that performative blogging shut down. First, it enables you to [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/); the practice of sharing what you learn as you're learning it, not a decade later once you're an "expert." <Footnote idName={9}>A label you may never officially earn unless you're in a highly structured and bureaucratised industry that loves explicit hierarchy rankings. The rest of us are left to deal with perpetual imposter syndrome.</Footnote>

This freedom of course comes with great responsibility. Publishing imperfect and early ideas **requires that we make the status of our notes clear to readers.** You should include some indicator of how "done" they are, and how much effort you've invested in them.

This could be with a simple categorisation system. I personally use an overly horticultural metaphor:

-   🌱 _Seedlings_ for very rough and early ideas
-   🌿 _Budding_ for work I've cleaned up and clarified
-   🌳 _Evergreen_ for work that is reasonably complete (though I still tend these over time).

I also include the dates I _planted_ and _last tended_ a post so people get a sense of how long I've been growing it.

<ImageFrame
    width="900px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621931871/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/metadata_jtz6od.png"
    alt="The metadata at the top of my posts showing growth stage"
/>

Other gardeners include an **epistemic status** on their posts – a short statement that makes clear how they know what they know, and how much time they've invested in researching it.

[Gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/index) was one of the earliest and most consistent gardeners to offer meta-reflections on their work.
Each entry comes with:

-   topic tags
-   start and end date
-   a stage tag: _draft_, _in progress_, or _finished_
-   a certainty tag: _impossible_, _unlikely_, _certain_, etc.
-   1-10 importance tag

These are all explained in their [website guide](https://www.gwern.net/About#confidence-tags), which is worth reading if you're designing your own epistemological system.

<ImageFrame
    width="900px"

    showalt
    alt="The metadata avaliable on each of Gwern's essays"
/>

Devon Zuegal is another notable gardener who has _epistemic status_ and _epistemic effort_ on their posts, indicating both their certainty level about the material, and how much effort went into making it. They also make a strong case for [lazy epistemic statuses](https://devonzuegel.com/post/epistemic-statuses-are-lazy-and-that-is-a-good-thing) as a feature, not a bug.

<ImageFrame
    width="900px"

    alt="Epistemic effort and epistemic status metadata at the top of Devon Zuegal's writing"
    showalt
/>

In a similar vein, Shawn Wang has written the Digital Gardening [Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos) which I adore and ascribe to. They ask the reader to allow the writer to be wrong, offer constructive criticism, and attribute their work. They ask gardeners to be considerate of others (don't share private information or name and shame), offer epistemic disclosure, and respond to feedback.

<img
    width="900px"
    src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6764957/75324412-e3bc2480-5844-11ea-90be-4a26b6a64000.png"
    alt="The digital gardening terms of service – Source: Shawn Wang, swyx.io"
    showalt
/>

All of these design patterns feed our growing desire for transparency, meta information, and breadcrumbs back to the source of ideas.

<Spacer />

### 4. Playful, Personal, and Experimental

Gardens are non-homogenous by nature. You can plant the same seeds as your neighbour, but you'll always end up with a different arrangement of plants.

Digital gardens should be just as unique and particular as their vegetative counterparts. The point of a garden is that it's a personal playspace. You organise the garden around the ideas and mediums that match your way of thinking, rather than off someone else's standardised template.

<BasicImage
    width="900px"
    alt="A row of four plants where three look identical and one is wild and different"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1609617065/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/unique-gardens_shrink.png"
/>

Ideally, this involves experimenting with the native languages of the web – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They're the most flexible and robust tools we have for building interconnected knowledge online. Gardens are a chance to question the established norms of a '_personal website_', and make space for weirder, wilder experiments.

That said, I should acknowledge that jumping into full-on web development is simply beyond the abilities and interests of many people. There is still room for personalisation and play if you're using a pre-made template or service – it'll just be within the constraints of that system.

One goal of these hyper-personalised gardens is deep **contextualisation**. The overwhelming lesson of the Web 2.0 social media age is that dumping millions of people together into decontextualised social spaces is a shit show. Devoid of any established social norms and abstracted from our specific cultural identities, we end up in awkward, aggravating exchanges with people who are socially incoherent to us. We know nothing of their lives, backgrounds, or belief systems, and have to assume the worst. Twitter only offers us a 240 character bio. Facebook pre-selects the categories it deems important about you – relationship status, gender, hometown.

Gardens offer us the ability to present ourselves in forms that aren't cookie cutter profiles. They're the higher-fidelity version, complete with quirks, contradictions, and complexity.

<Halfspacer />

### 5. Intercropping & Content Diversity

Gardens are not just a collection of interlinked words. While linear writing is an incredible medium that has served us well for a little over 5000 years, it is daft to pretend working in a single medium is a sufficient way to explore complex ideas.

It is also absurd to ignore the fact we're living in an audio-visual cornucopia that the web makes possible. Podcasts, videos, diagrams, illustrations, interactive web animations, academic papers, tweets, rough sketches, and code snippets should all live and grow in the garden.

<img
    width="800px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621781288/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/intercropping-garden_shrink_mx6nx8.png"
/>

Historically, monocropping has been the quickest route to starvation, pests, and famine. Don't be a lumper potato farmer while everyone else is sustainably intercropping.

<Halfspacer />

### 6. Independent Ownership

Gardening is about claiming a small patch of the web for yourself, one you fully own and control.

This patch should not live on the servers of Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram (aka. also Facebook), or Medium. None of these platforms are designed to help you slowly build and weave personal knowledge. Most of them actively fight against it.

If any of those services go under, your writing and creations sink with it (crazier things have happened in the span of humanity). None of them have an easy export button. And they certainly won't hand you your data in a transferable format.

<img
    width="880px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1622210536/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/interoperable_shrink_vmtvx6.png"
    alt="A set of walled gardens with the Twitter, Medium, and Facebook logos next to an open garden built on HTML, CSS, and Markdown"
/>

Independently owning your garden helps you plan for long-term change. You should think about how you want your space to grow over the next few decades, not just the next few months.

If you give it a bit of forethought, you can build your garden in a way that makes it easy to transfer and adapt. Platforms and technologies will inevitably change. Using old-school, reliable, and widely used web native formats like HTML/CSS is a safe bet. Backing up your notes as flat markdown files won't hurt either.

Keeping your garden on the open web also sets you up to take part in the future of gardening. At the moment our gardens are rather solo affairs. We haven't figure out how to make them multi-player. _But_ there's an enthusiastic community of developers and designers trying to fix that. It's hard to say what kind of libraries, frameworks, and design patterns might emerge out of that effort, but it certainly isn't going to happen behind a Medium paywall.

---

This is all my take on gardening, but knowledge and neologisms always live within communities. No one owns _The Official Definition_ of digital gardening. Numerous people have contributed to the growing conversation and you should read their thoughts as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
I spent last week falling down the dark, LED-adorned, discotheque-esque internet hole of custom [mechanical keyboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Mechanical-switch_keyboard).

I'd known the hole was there. I live in the world of developers where mechanical keyboards are a unifying community obsession. In a profession marked by immaterial creation, keyboards are one of the few tangible pieces of professional equipment they can fuss over. And fuss they do.

They debate the optimal amount of 'travel distance' a key should move when pressed. They have personal preferences for the type of tactile and audible feedback delivered by each key, a quality controlled by a color-coded range of "switches." Red switches are 'linear and smooth,' brown switches have a slight bump that 'actuate' with 45g of applied force, and blue switches make an obnoxious clacking noise like a sixties typewriter. They arrange lush colored keycaps into gorgeous palettes, all with blank keycaps because no real typist needs lettering. They reprogramme the keys and write macros to run on a single keystroke. Sets of RGB LEDs under the boards put on light shows worthy of a 1980's acid rave.

Understandably, navigating this array of options requires plenty of guidance. The internet swells with top 10 lists, best of lists, ultimate guides, complete guides, and updated guides for 2021 leading you through the labyrith of choices to find your Perfect Keyboard Design. Perky microcelebrities have built whole YouTube empires by reviewing the specific audio qualities of each switch type and brand. The 828,000 members of the [r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) subreddit curate an extensive wiki to answer common questions.

And all that only covers the introductory level for people buying moderately priced pre-made units. Dedicated keyboarders stock up on their own base plates, key stabilizers, and printed circuit boards to solder everything together in exactly the way they want.
It would probably be cheaper to just get the luxury $356 [Moonlander Mark I](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) or the $570 [Esrille](http://www.esrille.com/keyboard/) than to DIY it, but that's not the point. Art has little concern for price comparisons.

It's hard to believe that having a glowing rainbow pulse under your fingers is going to help you focus on structuring a user authentication flow, but no one is under the illusion these boards are about productivity.

They are gloriously anti-utilitarian. Developers will certainly rant about how the ergonomic layout of their Ergodox allows them to type 120 words per minute, but the level of flamboyant decoration happening in this space is undeniably about something much grander than efficiency.

These keyboards are expressive extensions of the self in the same way skateboard decks, ball gowns, tattoo sleeves, and instagrammable interior designs are. People have been painting their bodies with chalk and clay since neolithic times. The modern body simply includes mechanical machines.

<IntroParagraph>

There are some of us who believe digital life should be lived through a series of keyboard shortcuts. There is nothing quite as satisfying as making one quick keyboard gesture and watching a whole cascade of events unfold before you. This is the definition of programmatic magic.

</IntroParagraph>

I'm not just talking about vanilla hotkeys like `Cmd + S` or `Cmd + Q` that save a file or quit an application.

Any hotkey that triggers a single action like copying text to your clipboard is equally capable of performing multiple actions in quick succession; opening a specific set of files, launching multiple applications, pasting a pre-written string of text, playing a particular song in Spotify, starting a countdown timer, and arranging your desktop windows just the way you want them.

Anything you can manually do on your machine with your two hands can be wrapped up into a programmatic sequence and performed by the machine without you touching it.

These sequences are called **macros** and you don't need to know how to programme to create them. Programmatic plebs (like me) can build powerful automations without needing to write a bunch of BASH commands in the Terminal. <Footnote idName={1}>Programmers traditionally write macro scripts in a language like Bash or Python using the **Terminal** – an application you already have on your machine that allows you to control your computer with text-based commands.</Footnote>

You do need a macro application with a user-friendly interface though. IMHO [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) is one of the best designed and easiest to use options.<Footnote idName={2}>Now is the time to diclose that Keyboard Maestro have not paid, bribed, or manipulated me to write this post, and the link above is not an affiliate link. Doing this is all my choice as a KM enthusiast.</Footnote> It's a Mac app (sorry Windows users) that allows you to visually compose small sequences of actions that you can easily trigger at any time.

    alt="The Keyboard Maestro main window"

There are alternative (Windows-compatible) macro applications that can do similar things: [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/), [Automator](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/automator/welcome/mac), and [Macro Recorder](https://www.macrorecorder.com/). However, I haven't personally used these and will only be singing the praises of Keyboard Maestro from here on out.

This isn't going to be a beginner's guide to using Keyboard Maestro (hereafter known as KM), so I suggest you take a look at this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-M2ECt9gIc&list=PLa0EpEatE4TIUSob_dkMuDP7MpPceth30) and this TutsPlus [article series](https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/keyboard-maestro-i-introduction--cms-23415) if that's what you need. If you want to get extra intense about learning KM, David Sparks has created a very [comprehensive course](https://learn.macsparky.com/p/km) that covers everything under the macro sun. There is also an [official wiki](https://wiki.keyboardmaestro.com/doku.php) you can reference, but it throws you into the technical weeds a lot.

Rather than giving you I'm going to jump into the ways I use KM and the particular macros I find useful on a daily basis. By seeing some very tangible examples of what KM can do, perhaps you'll be intruiged and get ideas for what you might want to automate.

## Workflow Macros

One of the most basic groups of macros I rely on are what I call _workflow macros._

<ComingSoon />

<!-- Triggers can of course be hotkeys, but you can also use certain times of day, trackpad gestures, or typed strings of text as triggers. You can also use computational events as triggers: your machine waking up, a certain application launching, or connecting to a certain wifi network.

These actions can do anything you can do through manual interaction on your machine – type text, copy/paste from the clipboard, open menus, click buttons, launch applications, navigate to websites. It's a programmatic version of you that you write instructions for ahead of time. -->

<IntroParagraph>
    
Nearly every computer programme created in the last 68 years was made by typing linear characters into a text editor. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII"> ASCII</a> symbols arranged from left
to right, top to bottom, are the universal medium of code.

</IntroParagraph>

<img

    alt="Python code showing a function that solves the FizzBuzz challenge in a text file"
/>

Every language from FORTRAN to Python to Haskell works this way.

It's then unsurprising every major IDE <Footnote idName={1}>IDE stands for intergrated development environment. Essentially a souped up text editor with lots of helpful functionality for programmers baked in.</Footnote> and code editor is designed to optimise working in text; VS Code, Vim, PyCharm, WebStorm, xCode, Atom, Sublime Text are all text-first environments.

<BasicImage
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1627423845/maggieappleton.com/notes/learnable-programming/code-editors_rabptu.png"
    alt="The standard text-heavy interfaces of WebStorm, xCode, and VSCode"
    imageWidth="1300px"
    showalt
/>

This might seem so obvious it's not worth pointing out. Textual programming is the water we swim in. We express computation logic in written text because that must naturally and obviously the best medium for it. At least, this is what we tell ourselves from the vantage point of people who have only ever lived in a textual programming world.

What, exactly, might be the alternative to programming in pure text? Am I suggesting we interpretive dance our way through a function that prints out the Fibonacci sequence?

Not exactly. Although I would like to see someone try.

What I want to explore here is the relative **lack of visuals, graphics, and spatial design** in our current programming environments. While we've crafted widely accessible graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for everyone else, programmers remain in the land of typed commands. As the mediators between meatspace and binary logic, we don't get to click buttons, drag sliders, pan canvases, or select options from dropdown menus while we build. Instead, we type.

There are plenty of good reasons for this – both historical and logical – that we'll get into. Understanding how we ended up in this purely textual place is a necessary first step if we want to question it.

<Halfspacer />

## Inventing the End User

In the early 1980's a wide new divide opened up. With the rise of personal computing and the arrival of accessible machines like the Macintosh, we created a clear distinction between "programmers" and "end users." Before that point, the people who designed and wrote computer programmes were primarily the same people who used computer programmes. You couldn't do much of one without the other.

And all of these people were exclusively using text to talk to their machines. Because it was the only show in town.

The aesthetic of bright green blocky text on black terminals isn't just a fun, retro media trope – our pre-GUI interfaces geuinely looked like this.

<BasicImage

Before the 1980's showed up with its neon leg warmers and big hair, most computers _didn't even have screens_. You blindly typed commands onto a keyboard that punched holes into paper.

<Draft />

Many, many programmers will argue programming in linear text is simply _better_. And they're not entirely wrong. Textual notation is an extremely efficient way to condense meaning. It's quick to write and allows us to create precise abstractions other programmers can interpret and work with.

By _graphical_ I mean any arrangement of shapes (square, circle, irregular nonagon, what have you) in space that aren't written words.

By _spatial_ I mean the way we use our understanding of being a body with a front, back, left, right, up, and down, to understand the world around us.

Humans are exceptionally skilled at spatial thinking.

Using visual representations like maps, diagrams, and shapes in 2D / 3D space to communicate meaning is something we've been doing far longer than we've been typing text into screens. About 43,832 years longer. <Footnote idName={2}>Taking the 43,900 y.a. hunting scenes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1806-y">found</a> in Sulawesi, Indonesia as a conservative marker of when we first started doing pictorial storytelling on surfaces around us</Footnote> Given all that time, humans are much better at reasoning using graphical and spatial mappings than they are with linear abstract text.

I am certainly not to first to find it odd. People have been harping on about the limitations of textual programming since the beginning of programming. These complainers tend to gather under the umbrella of **Visual Programming** – a field that encompasses so many efforts and projects it's hard to figure out what it wants.

<Halfspacer />

## What is Visual Programming?

Good question.

The name itself is a bit of a misnomer since anything we see with our eyes technically counts as _visual._ Which would certainly include linear text. When people use the term they are usually referring to some kind of **spatial** or **graphical** programming environment.

<Halfspacer />

## Visual Programming for Learnable Programming

Bret Victor coined the term <b>Learnable Programming</b> in his <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming">canonical essay</a> lamenting the current state of programming education. Bret has a few concerns with the way most of us learn to code. Mainly that the learning environments we drop people into are poorly designed.

These environments tend to look something like this:

    Interfaces from Repl.it, Codesandbox, freeCodeCamp, and Khan Academy
</span>

They're your standard column-based "live coding" interfaces popular across the industry. You write code into one section, and hopefully get the output you expected in another. Syntax is abstracted away from the elements it affects.

<Halfspacer />

### Programming into the Void

It's easy to see why these linear, text-based interfaces _seem_ like the best approach. They look identical to the standard interfaces the whole development industry uses to programme.

We write code into an isolated text editor. If you type the correct sequence of words and symbols into the editor, the correct series of events happens somewhere out of view.

We start this process in a context that looks something like this...

<MysteriousVoid />

...and get the output in a separate browser window. God only know what happened in the middle.

Functions ran in an some unseen JavaScript engine, interface elements drew themselves onto the canvas, and somewhere a value changed in a distant database.

We're only shown the end result. To see anything happening in the middle, we have to `console.log` out data at each step of the way. Or dig into dense developer panels and debuggers. The industry has accepted flying blind as standard operating procedure.

<Halfspacer />

### Raising the Programming Bar

We're training people in the same kind of environment they'll be working in professionally. In the just-get-a-job-mindset that's an excellent approach. But Bret isn't talking about the ideal way to learn programming in the short-term, bootcampy world view. When he talks about these environments as inadequate, he's referencing a much larger paradigm shift around how we should design human-computer interfaces.

He's pointing out that the standard text-based, disembodied, non-graphical interfaces we all put up with are unintuitive to humans who live in a highly visual, spatial, embodied world. While most of our modern user interfaces have graduated to a graphical, 3D space-based system, programming is staunchly attached to the linear text paradigm.

There's good reason for this. While many people have tried to develop [visual programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language), they've largely failed to gain traction. There's lots of [well-reasoned](https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/visual-programming-language/) [arguments](https://dzone.com/articles/visual-programming-why-its-a-bad-idea) [explaining](https://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2018/10/visual-programming-why-its-bad-idea.html) why it's so difficult to design visual systems complex and extensible enough to programme in, so I won't repeat them here.
The fact is that our current visual languages aren't sophisticated enough to do the job, and we're a long way from any system that could.

<Halfspacer />

### Visual Programming for Learning

While visual programming isn't great for the scale of complexity professional programmers deal with, it's _ideal_ for people who are learning to code. When we simply need to explain what's happening under the hood, graphical representations are the best way to help people build clear mental models.

Computer history legends like [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) and [Seymour Paypert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert) were the earliest champions of using intuitive visuals to teach programming. Paypert developed a language called [Logo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)>) in the late 1960's where you would type commands to direct a small green turtle around the screen, leaving a visible trail behind it. Through simple instructions like `go(20)` and `turn(90)` and `for i in range(12): go(20) turn(30)` you could draw elaborate graphic patterns. It became widely used in education and a whole generation began their programming lives in Logo.

    alt="A classic example of a logo-based interface where you direct a small turtle around a canvas. Source: pythonturtle.org"
    showalt
/>

My own earliest memory of programming involved directing one of these small green amphibians around in circles. If you want a little throwback, you can play with a live Turtle environment at [Turtle Academy](https://turtleacademy.com/playground)

The modern manifestation of Logo is MIT's [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) learning platform. It expanded the character range beyond just turtles, offering everything from llamas to dancing starfish. It also gives you the syntax as drag-n-drop blocks which visually distinguish variables from loops, logic operations, events, and motion commands.

    alt="The scratch learning platform that allows you to construct clear visual chains of programming commands"
    showalt
/>

If we look past the campy, child-friendly aesthetics of Scratch, it's hard to argue this kind of visual interface isn't helpful. There is no need to memorise the syntax, it's easy to browse through the available commands, and the physical shape and color of each command limits makes clear where you can and can't put it. Hovering over operations shows you whether they're true or false and variables reveal their current value.

    alt="A selection of the avaliable programming commands in Scratch"

I could wax lyrical about the genius of this approach for paragraphs but I'll spare you. The [autocomplete](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense), syntax highlighting, and linter systems in modern IDEs <Footnote idName={3}>IDE stands for integrated development environment. These are pimped out code editors that offer programmers a buffet a helpful tools like debuggers, git logs, and advanced search functionality. VSCode, WebStorm, and XCode are all popular IDEs</Footnote> get us close to this, but offer just enough freedom to still hang ourselves sometimes. You also need to know IDEs exist in the first place, and _then_ learn how to setup and effectively use one; a heady challenge in itself. Many beginners flail around in blank, unresponsive code files with no autocompletion, syntax snippets, or linters to assist them until someone lets them in on the industry secret (speaking from personal experience here).

## Principles of Learnable Programming

Let's circle back to Bret Victor and his concept of _learnable programming_. Bret outlined a set of principles he believed all programming environments should follow if they want their learners to make any headway. He argues a good environment should allow learners to:

1. **Read the vocabulary** of a language by making clear what each keyword and function does
2. **Follow the flow** of what happens at each stage in executing a programme
3. **See the state** as the programme changes variables over time
4. **Create by reacting** to how the programme behaves
5. **Create by abstracting** from the simple to the complex

Most of these are explicitly **visual**. We need to make what's happening in the programme _readable_ through visual representations of each syntax element, variable, and change of state over time. As Bret puts it:

> "People understand what they can see. If a programmer cannot see what a program is doing, she can't understand it."

I won't expand on these too much as Bret elaborates on them in the [original piece](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming) and provides plenty of tangible examples of how they might look in an interface. These principles amount to a kind of [[Pattern Language]] - they're a set of design rules that loosely define how a system should work, rather than a strict specification or implementation.

Since Bret wrote his piece in 2012, it's recieved plenty of buzz and cultish admiration (deservedly, IMHO). But I haven't seen it fully applied in any live learning platforms.

The world of programming education has certainly stepped up its visual game over the last decade. It's no longer just two column, text-based execution contexts. We're now swimming in interactive visual environments and gamified educational platforms.

I began researching the field to see how many of them were putting Bret's principles into practice. The examples I looked at ranged from full-on illustrated games to lightly animated sequences of text. As I explored, I started to notice design patterns beyond the principles Bret outlined.

While Bret defined a set of ideals for a hypothetical learning platform, I became more interested in finding patterns in what already exists. While we're a long way from achieving the '_ideal_' system, there's plenty of good design happening here and now.

You might have noticed the content on this site spans the full array of my weirdo interests and niches.

Cultivated meat is certainly part of that equation.

If you've never heard of _"cultivated meat"_, this will be a great primer.

I spent the Christmas lull of 2019 devouring Ben Wurgaft's book 'Meat Planet'.
Needing an outlet for my weird over-enthusiasm with it, I started working through my notes and picking out the best themes and ideas to turn into a set of illustrated explorations.

## Meat Planet: Artificial flesh and the future of food

#### by Ben Wurgaft

Meat Planet is an anthropological and historical tour through the quest to generate meat in the lab—a substance sometimes called “cultured meat.” The journey asks what it means to imagine that this might be the future of food.

</div>

</TwoColumn>

I'd been following the media hype around the promise of 'cultivated meat' since early 2017 -- mostly as a curious layperson who indulges in reading Silicon Valley techno-utopian gossip the way others watch Keeping Up with Ru Paul's Real Housewives of Love Island.

I was primarily drawn to the cultural implications of the idea.

Seen through an anthropological lens, cultivated meat prompts a series of fascinating questions;

-   What do we mean by 'natural' and 'unnatural', 'real' and 'fake'?
-   Why do some people react to the idea with disgust and revulsion? What makes us culturally categorise things as 'icky' and 'gross'?
-   How do we define the categorical boundaries and rules around food, and how malleable is that framework?

Since most of the discussion was happening on Hacker News and Twitter (not usually founts of philosophical reflection), I didn't expect anyone to meaningfully explore these questions.

The chatter instead orbited around short-term technological viability, or time-to-market, or IPO stock price speculations of hypothetical products.

I was then thrilled to see an anthropologist & historian step into the ring among all the TED-talky-thought-leadering-VCs.

Ben approached the topic through a series of wide-scale historical, cultural, and sociopolitical questions on the nature of what meat is without the dead cow involved.

He uses the promise of animal-free meat as a jumping off point into deeper historical trends about scientific ideologies, Calvinistic Capitalism, and the presumed division of nature and culture.

Ben's neutrality is a large part of what makes this a good read - he's not for or against it, he's curious.

His agenda is to make you think on a very different level than the mountain of Wired articles on the topic. And he's asking way better questions than _when can I buy it?_, _will it give me cancer?_, and _what will we do with all the cows??_

Reading this book was akin to having a far more intelligent and academically informed companion take my half-formed pedestrian observations and flesh them out into high-definition, coherent scenes.

Be warned they're not a comprehensive summary of the book.

They're selected snippets filtered through my own research interests and curiosities. With a good dose of extra commentary layered on top.  
If they pique your interest, I promise there's plenty more meat in the actual book <span>🍖</span>

<IntroParagraph>

Nature is flourishing down at my local Sainsbury's. The mineral water is natural. The unrefined cane sugar is natural. The low-fat Greek style yogurt is natural. The gluten-free buckwheat toasted muesli is natural. The anti-oxidising cranberry, chocolate, and coconut vegan protein bars are natural.

</IntroParagraph>

"Natural" has become both a ubiquitous and meaningless label on food packaging. This observation is nothing profound. Hundreds of op-ed authors have lamented the lack of governmental regulation stopping producers from putting "natural," "free-range," "wholegrain," "authentic," "superfood," and "organic" on their shiny cereal box of sugar puffs. We have all become comfortably jaded with the empty, hyperbolic language of our food. At least enough to not take it seriously.

But this is not a diatribe about food packaging. The bone I'm picking is not with the label on my chicken, but the chicken's supposed origin – **nature.**

At its core, nature defines the world without humans in it. It is everything that the birds, bacteria, forests, fish, and ocean currents do without our input. We consider it distinct and opposed to the expansion pack that humans brought to life; culture. We think of culture as everything humans layer on top of the natural world; the icing on the cosmic cake.

At least, this is one version of the mythological story; the one most of us accept as historical fact. Hominids sprang up in South Africa 40,000 years ago and began carving wooden digging sticks, smearing red ochre on one another, and threading long necklaces made from shards of ostrich eggs. While they were busy decorating, the cosmic fabric split and created a division. The world before the humans, and the world after. At least this is the story we, the humans, tell ourselves.

<IntroParagraph>

Up until recently, the idea of [[Digital Gardening]] was unknown outside the world of web development.<Footnote idName={1}>If you're new to the idea of digital gardening I suggest you read my essay on the [history and ethos](/garden-history) of it first.</Footnote> All of the early gardeners were web developers to some degree – we all knew our way around a Github repo, could paste commands into the terminal, and hack things together enough to get an experimental website up and running.

</IntroParagraph>

Because the movement began with a technical crowd, all the initial tools assumed a certain level of knowledge around HTML/CSS, JavaScript, DNS redirects, and static site generators.

My own collection of [digital gardening tools](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) on Github will point you towards various frameworks and plugins designed for gardening... but most of the solutions require a reasonably high level of technical literacy.

I kept receiving messages from folks who desperately wanted to get in on the gardening action, but described themselves as "non-technical." <Footnote idName={2}>I want to acknowledge calling anyone _non-technical_ is controversial, since it suggests some people are inherently unable to code or wade through complex digital tools. I obviously don't believe that's the case, but want to recognise some folks feel less comfortable programming and troubleshooting digital systems than others.</Footnote> I hated telling these folks I didn't know how to help them.

Thankfully, that's starting to change. Over the last year, a number of tools have popped up that make it _much_ easier to plant a digital garden without touching code. As the idea of digital gardening [spreads](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/), these accessible services will become critical. The gardening gates are finally opening so more folks can cultivate their own corner of the web.

## Gardening with Notion

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is one of the easiest and quickest ways to start building a digital garden when you're not code-savvy.

Notion claims it's a note-taking app for teams – a shared space for documentation and planning. Which it is. However, it's also secretly one of the best tools for building no-code websites.

<ImageFrame
    alt="The Notion homepage which presents itself as a notes app for teams"
    showalt
    width="1000px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1622718832/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/notionhome_td8vd5_shrink_c6pnkg.png"
/>

Think of Notion as Google Docs on steroids. It allows you to create pages of text using plain markdown. You can then style that text, create multi-column layouts, add images, embed links, and build spreadsheets in the middle of a document. You can also link these pages together, which begins to make Notion look strangely like a simple website builder. 🤔

I won't go into the details of how to use Notion here. If you're new to Notion I recommend you watch this [intro video](https://www.notion.so/guides/notion-training-the-basics) (8 mins), play around in the app for a bit, watch their [advanced tutorial](https://www.notion.so/guides/notion-training-advanced) (13 mins), then watch [How to Publish Notion Pages](https://www.notion.so/guides/publish-notion-pages-to-the-web) to the web. This should give you the 80/20 on how Notion works.

The two killer features that make digital gardening possible in Notion are **backlinks** and **share to web.**

**Backlinks** are a [fairly new feature](https://www.notion.so/guides/creating-links-and-backlinks) in Notion. They make it possible to create [[Bi-directional Links]] between pages, meaning each page shows which other pages are linked to it. This allows you to build up deeply interlinked content – one of the hallmarks of a digital garden. People browsing your garden can jump between related pages anywhere on the site, rather than only being able to navigate posts in chronological order.

<ImageFrame
    width="1000px"
    showalt
    alt="Backlinks in Notion show up right underneath the title of a page"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1622718954/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/roam-backlink_shrink_vjkwyj.png"
/>

The second important feature is the **Share to Web** button. This allows you to create a Notion document and publish it to the web in one click. Anyone can visit that link and view your document. You now essentially have a website without needing to worry about hosting, domains, web frameworks, or a CMS. 👏 Slow 👏 Clap 👏

You can find Notion's **Share to Web** feature under the **Share** menu in the top right corner of each page.

<ImageFrame
    width="1000px"
    showalt
    alt="An example of where to find Notion's 'Share to Web' settings"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1623402131/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/roam-garden-share_shrink_shrink_kwlpxi.png"
/>

I went ahead and built a very small, pretend digital garden to show you how this might work. I created a few basic pages (about and contact me), and built two databases – one for writing and one for books. Here's [the live version](https://www.notion.so/Maggie-s-Pretend-Garden-ad29880fed054ba1a0872d3e06252f81) you can poke around.

<ImageFrame
    width="1000px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1622718505/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/roam-fake-garden_qvgrrz_shrink_oodv8u.png"
    alt="My example digital garden in Notion"
    showalt
/>

This example is very basic, so it will probably help to look at more fully grown Notion gardens like [Philip in the Woods](https://philipb.cc/) and [Chinarut's Digital Greenhouse](https://www.notion.so/Chinarut-s-Digital-Greenhouse-9b31c7ba8efc4bf9adcfa17a38c841ff).

### Notion's Downsides – SEO, Speed, and Domain Names

There are three major issues with using Notion as a website or digital garden:

1. **Poor SEO** – Notion pages aren't designed for **search engine optimization** (SEO). This means anything you publish to your garden won't be easy to find via search engines like Google or DuckDuckGo. This might not seem like a big deal, but it means people who would find your content useful and relevant might never find it.
2. **Slow Speeds** – Notion isn't optimised for speed. It can be very slow to load on mobile devices. If you have a lot of images on your Notion garden this slows things down even more.
3. **No Custom Domain Names** – Your domain name is the URL people type into their address bar to get to your site (eg. _gardening.com_). Having a domain name that is memorable and not too long makes it easier for people to remember the address and share your site with others. When you build a garden on Notion, you can't choose your own domain name.

### Solutions: Notion-as-a-Website Services

Luckily, there are solutions to all the disappointing issues I just described.

Three services have appeared that help you turn your Notion into a more legitimate website with SEO indexing, faster pages, and custom domain names: [Fruition](https://fruitionsite.com/) (free, but a little technical to setup), [Super](https://super.so/) ($12/month) and [Host Notion](https://hostnotion.co/) ($5/month) <Footnote idName={3}>None of these services have paid me to recommend them, and those aren't affiliate links. I haven't personally used them myself, so take a look at each option and decide for yourself.</Footnote>

Notion is also responding to the fact more people are using it as a website-builder and improving these problems. They recently added SEO indexing if you pay for the _Personal Pro_ plan ($4/month), and are reportedly working on custom domains and speed improvements. I wouldn't be surprised if they strategically lean into this Notion-as-a-Website trend in future product features.

## Gardening with Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a fairly new app that's primarily a private knowledge base, but also allows you to publish a selection of your notes as a public website.

It has many of the fancy features we've come to associate with the "[tools for thought](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/tools-thought)" space, building [Second Brains](/basb), and digital gardening. These include [[Bi-directional Links]], hover previews, and visual graph overviews.

<ImageFrame
    showalt
    alt="What the Obsidian desktop app looks like with markdown notes and a visual graph"
    width="1100px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1620631584/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/obsidian-home_wsyxt1.png"
/>

It also requires very little technical know-how to use. All your writing is stored as simple markdown files, so importing and exporting notes from other apps is easy.

The private notes app is free to use, but if you want to publish your notes to the web it's $8 per month. [Moby Diction](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/_About)'s garden and [Joschua's Garden](https://joschuasgarden.com/) are both good examples of what a live Obsidian site looks like.

<ImageFrame
    showalt
    alt="What a live obsidian website looks like"
    width="1100px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1620562494/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/joschua.png"
/>

You have some control over over the visual presentation of your Obsidian website, but it's limited by your skills with CSS. <Footnote idName={4}>Cascading Style-Sheets are the way we apply visual styles to websites. If you've never written any, I'd highly recommend working through Khan Academy's short [Intro to HTML/CSS](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css) course. It will make a world of difference helping you understand the basics of how a webpage works.</Footnote> They have a few basic themes you can pick from, so it's up to you how much time and effort you want to invest in customising it.

My only bugbear with Obsidian is that it's obsessively text-focused, and doesn't give you much space to play with images, visual styles, or layouts. Some people will consider this a feature, not a bug. 🙃 I personally find the format restrictive, but it's part of my much larger gripe with the note-taking space and its [[obsession with linear text]].

Overall, Obsidian is a great option for anyone who wants to keep their garden simple, non-technical, and get up and running quickly. I think it has a bright future given the enthusiastic community rallying around it.

## Gardening with Roam

[Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) is one of the cornerstones of the digital gardening movement and its associated philosophies of knowledge graphs, zettelkasten, and learning in public.

Roam is primarily used for private note-taking, but also allows you to publish publicly visible knowledge graphs others can browse.

<ImageFrame
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1623401197/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/roamsharesettings_hg3gzm.png"
    alt="The Roam settings panel where you can select who can read or edit a graph"
    showalt
    width="1000px"
/>

Roam is an easy way to make a quick digital garden, but it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of aesthetics and the experience for people who come to your Roam graph. There's not a lot of easily visible context around who's graph this is, what they write about, and how to navigate the space.

[Roam Garden](https://roam.garden/) is a new service that helps solve a lot of these problems. It allows you to use Roam as your source of notes and selectively sync a section of your graph to the public web in a format that is much friendlier for visitors. You can land them on a homepage that explains how to browse and gives them a few entry points.

If you're already using Roam as your primary note-taking space this system might be your best bet. It's $7.50 per month and is a big aesthetic step up from using Roam directly.

<ImageFrame
    showalt
    alt="The standard layout of a website built with Roam Garden"
    width="1100px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1200/v1622718841/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/roam-garden_rcuvdi_shrink_wvm5mv.png"
/>

The only limitation of this system is that the visual formatting is fairly strict. It's similar to Obsidian in that you can't do much customisation of layout or styling. It does however include all the "standard" features like link previews, sliding windows, a visual graph, and (of course) backlinks between pages.

Here's an [example website](https://vlad.roam.garden/) built with Roam Garden. As Roam Research grows, I expect services of this nature will develop alongside it.

<Halfspacer />

## What Gardens are Not

I want to add a final note on here: we should be careful not to mistake the technical features of a garden for the ethos of gardening. We have reached the point in the gardening hype train where people seem to think backlinks, hover previews, and visual graphs are what define a "digital garden."

This is misguided. Gardening is a practice that treats a personal website as a constantly evolving landscape where you develop your ideas in public.

Gardens are...  
a) **Explorable**, rather than structured as a strictly linear steam of posts. This is usually achieved through deeply interlinking notes where readers can navigate freely through the content.  
b) **Slowly grown over time**, rather than creating "finished" work that you never touch again. You revise, update, and change your ideas as they develop, and ideally find a way to indicate the "done-ness" state to your reader.

No framework, platform, plug-in, service, or fun interface element defines a garden, and never will. Do whatever works for you, at whatever technical level feels comfortable. Just keep gardening <span role="img">🪴</span>

<IntroParagraph>

Every major note-taking app on the market works one way: linearly, in text.

</IntroParagraph>

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/), [Bear](https://bear.app/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). They are all centred around writing text documents that flow from left-to-right, then top-to-bottom; the way all text works in English. Even if they support other languages, you'd still write Arabic or Hebrew or Urdu linearly, just right-to-left.

You might say this is what defines a _note_; it is a chunk of written text, presented as a small piece of digital paper. It's pretending to be a real piece of paper, but without many of the features that make real paper useful. Like the ability make marks on it that are not simply words in a straight line.

<ImageFrame
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621509754/maggieappleton.com/notes/linear-notes/linear-scrawl_shrink_juilyb.png"
    showalt
    alt="How it might look if we could draw into our notes without being confined to linear text"
    width="900px"
/>

I find it odd that few apps put sincere effort into becoming more paper-like. Most are too busy trying to become more _hyper_, in the _hyper_-text sense. They pride themselves on their multi-device compatibility, cloud synchronicity, and API integration automations. None of them question the central organising medium of linear text.

In this linear text-based ideology, images are second-class citizens. Illustrations, diagrams, graphics, photographs, doodles, drawings, and icons are visitors here.

You're welcome to pop them "inline", like a pseudo-text element that inconveniently isn't subscribing to the rules. But you're going to have to make your images elsewhere. This is a note-taking app, not a drawing app (we have to wonder when those became two separate things). You'll have to draw somewhere else. Probably on another device. Which you'll have to buy separately. And yes, it will be prohibitively expensive. Unless you've found a way to draw by tapping out lines with your keyboard.

If you're lucky, your particular note-taking app might let you change the size of this image. Good luck trying to place two images next to each other though. Multi-column layouts and horizontal movement are beyond our current note-taking capacities.

Physical space is our third-class citizen. Your notes are only allowed to move to the right and down. You cannot move left, upwards, diagonally, in front, behind, or past Go.

<HackyFormatting />

You cannot freely drag things around and place them wherever you like. That would make it too much like the real world, where we can place one sticky note to the left of another, place both above a small notecard, arrange these next to a book with sticky notes inside it, and pile it all on top a ripped out page from a notebook covered in haphazard scribbles and doodles, half of them upside-down.

One wonders how we haven't hung ourselves with this amount of spatial freedom.

So, who is to blame for our linear, textual predicament?

The designers who invented the paper-based desktop metaphor that haunts all modern interface design? The users who behave like blind, inconsiderate drunks when presented with any slightly novel note-taking system? The venture capitalists who exclusively fund these predictable apps? The entire educational system for its incessant focus on textual literacy over spatial and visual literacy?

Surely, Gutenberg has something to answer for.

<IntroParagraph>

Behaving Paleolithic is one of the most effective ways to signal you are _with it_ in the Anthropocene.

</IntroParagraph>

Over the last decade, in a geological epoch we've decided is so distinctly "human" we appointed ourselves its namesake, we've become enamoured with a story of life 3.3 million years ago. Back when humans were a tiny smear on earth's surface, and no one gave a shit about carbon credits, microplastics, opioid overdoses, or whether modern monetary theory should be taken seriously.

Paleolithic peoples, so the tale goes, spent most of Tuesday strolling under Baobab trees, running their hands through the long elephant grass, and breathing in the sweet dust of the open Savannah. On Wednesdays they carefully chipped away the edges of Levallois blades, swept dust out of the home cave, and snacked on freshly gathered almonds. On Thursdays they gathered into small bands – a hand-picked selection of the finest endurance runners this side of Nairobi – tracked down an elephant, and sprinted after it barefoot for nine hours until the creature – dehydrated, exhausted, and unable to sweat out the excess heat – crumpled into a violently sad face-plant in the hot, gritty sand. Our strapping, supple ancestors jogged to a halt beside it, barely out of breath, to carve up its flesh and bring home the elephant bacon. Later that evening they would break their 36 hour intermittent fast, retire to the lake, and engage in polyamorous affairs.

We know all this to be true. National Geographic told us so. Or rather, National Geographic made hairy clay figurines, arranged them in an imagined stone age diorama, photoshopped mammoths, giant sloths, and glyptodons into the background, and burned that image into the eyeballs of every small child born after 1980.

This vision of life before We Ruined Everything is an alluring fever dream. In a moment where we are tightly tangled in the wicked problems of climate change – a series of widespread human failures that will end in our ecosystem cooking, drowning, starving, and suffocating the most vulnerable of us – nothing sounds quite as appealing as rewinding the clock. Ctrl + Z please.

Paleolithic people of the 21st century are simply trying to get back to [[Nature]]. They fill their Amazon carts with 12-packs of Primal Pantry Coconut Macadamia Raw Snack Bars ($15.99 with free next-day delivery on Prime – score). They melt pats of Land-O-Lakes butter into their morning Nespresso shot, and snack on seasoned bone broth concentrate to mimic the diet of yesteryear. They sprint 3.5 miles on treadmills in Vibram Five Fingered shoes to remind their feet how run using the Pose Method™️.

They refuse to join the swath of soft, sensitive, snowflake bodies, hunched over glowing MacBook screens and posting Marxist memes to [r/LateStageCapitalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/), licking Harvest Cheddar powder off their fingertips in between keystrokes.

This is not meant as an unkind, savage critique. I write this as someone who runs in barefoot shoes and tries not to eat things my great-great-great grandmother [wouldn't recognize](https://michaelpollan.com/articles-archive/six-rules-for-eating-wisely/) as food.

As a participant in our collective paleolithic nostalgia, I find it curious. Why do we long for a time when the average life span [was 22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy#Maximum) and everyone was wracked by [tuberculosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3313944/)?

<IntroParagraph>

In 2013, in a dutch cellular engineering lab just outside of Utrecht, pharmacologist Mark Post [produced a piece of meat](https://www.new-harvest.org/mark_post_cultured_beef) without killing an animal. <Footnote idName={1}>That's the short version of the story, for the meaty details take a look at [my illustrated notes](/meat-planet) on the matter</Footnote>

</IntroParagraph>

This is terribly impressive. But also splatters a gigantic can of worms across our definition of "meat." And by extension the entire food pyramid.

What is meat without a dead animal? How is that possible? And why does it make some people internally recoil deep in their gut?

---

## Why do we think 'lab-grown' meat is dirty, icky, or dangerous?

As Mary Douglas so poetically put it, "[[dirt is matter out of place]]." Anything that breaks our known order of the world that we design is a potential threat.

Food is a structured system - from the bite to the dish to the course to mealtimes to the weekly sunday roast to the monthly fast to the annual festival.

We get obsessive about creating rules, divisions, and norms around food. There are times and places and contexts to eat specific things. Oatmeal doesn't belong at the evening dinner party. Wine with breakfast is a disease. Combining cabbage with cake would lead to losing a few friends.

New forms of meat are suspect and transgressive because they cross our established boundaries.

Plant-based meats like the [Beyond Burger](https://www.beyondmeat.com/products/the-beyond-burger/) sit in neither the plant nor animal world, appearing as one while made from the other.

Our current food classifications do not have space for them. The division between vegetables and meat is fundamental. Plants vs animals. Fibre vs protein. Inert vs sentient. Green vs red.

Cultured meat, on the other hand, denies a fundamental part of the definition of meat. The dead animal part.

## The Great Wall of Nature/Culture

There is an imaginary wall in our minds that divides the word of Nature from the world of Culture. We seem to believe these are eternal, inherent categories of things in the world.

Mushrooms are Natural goodness incarnate, and microplastics are a polluting castoff from the Cultural behaviour of humans.

It wasn't always there. The men of 18th century "Western" rationalist science built it - Francis Bacon, Rene Descartes, and their kin.

Some are so intent on their desire, they've gone out and bought themselves iPads. The other half are actively thinking about buying an iPad right now.

They message me a lot.

> Which iPad should I buy? What app do you use? What brush is that? What size should my canvas be?

These questions aren't wrong. In fact they're perfectly reasonable.

I'm vocal about the fact many of my illustrations are made on [an iPad](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/) in an app called [Procreate](https://procreate.art/). I have a full post about my drawing equipment and workflows over at [[What App Is That?]]

How are you supposed to draw if you don't also have these fancy tools?

This is the tricky bit.

If you go out and buy yourself these same things, you'll have all the right **materials** to draw. But that's only the dressing on the drawing dish.

# What you have is **Material** without the **Medium** or the **Meat**

What on earth do I mean by _material_, _medium_, and _meat_?

<MediumMaterialsMeatSection sectionTitle='Materials'>

<p>
    <i>Materials</i> are the physical tools you draw with. Suffice to say, you
    need some way to make visible marks on a surface. Having precise control
    over how you make those marks is essential. Being able to erase is helpful.
    Having access to all the colors of the rainbow is a indulgent bonus.

</p>

<p>Everyone obsesses over the materials when they want to begin drawing. Which exact pen? What brand of paper? These questions matter. A little. Your materials affect what you can and can't do. But they don't matter nearly as much as everyone thinks they do.

Pick any of the above suggestions I've linked to and move onto the next step as soon as possible. This is not a lifelong commitment. You can change materials later if you ask nicely. <Footnote idName={2}>Hot tip: it's easier to swap materials if you don't pay an arm, a leg, and a kidney for them up front</Footnote></p>

</MediumMaterialsMeatSection>

<MediumMaterialsMeatSection sectionTitle='Medium'>

When you set out to draw, you're working in the <i>Medium</i> of <b>visual language</b>. Just like writing a non-fiction essay, giving a speech, or programming in Python, visual language is a form of communication. It has it's own syntax, style, and structure.

Composition. Value. Contrast. Light. Shadow. color. Form. Shape language. Linear perspective. 3D construction. Line weight. Emphasis. Pattern. Balance. Rhythm. These are the equivalent of characters, verbs, sentences, introductory paragraphs, and satirical post-modern novels. They're a means to an end – a way to get a message across the gap between your mind and someone else's.

Mastering the medium of visual language is the true struggle of drawing. Not picking which iPad app to draw in. The material is a convenient distraction when understanding the medium is an incomprehensible and daunting task.

You are right to be afraid of the medium. I'm still afraid of it. Learning all it's dimensions, elements, and variations is a lifelong challenge. It's an [infinite game](/infinite-games). There is no end goal. You just get to keep playing.

</MediumMaterialsMeatSection>

<MediumMaterialsMeatSection sectionTitle='Meat'>

The <i>Meat</i> is <b>the whole point of your illustration</b>. What is your drawing <i>about? </i> What are you <i>saying?</i> Why does it <i>matter?</i>

As one of my favourite writing professors used to say, -39 points for not having a point.

If we're going to put in the effort to craft an entire illustration, it better be for something worthwhile. You need an idea, a concept, or a piece of information you want to move from your mind into the minds of other people. Without meat, you're not serving any brain food to your audience. Which is why paintings of carefully arranges vases, daffodils, and clementines are disastrously dull. <Footnote idName={3}>IMHO. You might be really into Baroque vase paintings. It's great craftsmanship, but they don't say much beyond <b>"Look, a vase! Also, I've figured out how to pedantically paint realistic subjects!"</b><br /> Which has now been said enough times, and you probably don't need to add to the chorus.</Footnote>

</MediumMaterialsMeatSection>

Worrying about the materials should take up - at most - 10% of your attention and concern.

Focus 70% of your attention on learning the medium while you're just starting out.

You can keep 20% of your focus on the Meat. But I wouldn't worry too much about communicating original, profound ideas at first. Doing so _in addition to_ learning a whole new language is going to be overwhelming.

In the same way it's a bad idea to learn Spanish while simultaneously trying to write a philosophy dissertation in it.

Once you get more comfortable "speaking" in visual language, you'll be able to shift a much higher percentage of your attention onto the Meat. You'll get to focus on The Thing You Want to Say, and know enough visual language to say it well.

That's the ideal I'm currently striving for. To reach a point where the Material is irrelevant, the Medium is a baked into my subconscious, and I'm all about the Meat.

<Center>

# 2% Material, 18% Medium, 80% Meat.

</Center>

<br />

<p>
    That's the goal. Don't let the shiny iPad reflection blind you.
    <br />
    Get past picking the Material. Focus on the Medium. Aim for the Meat.

<IntroParagraph>

In 1965 [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) imagined a system of interactive, extendable text where words would be freed from the constraints of paper documents. This _hypertext_ would make documents linkable.

Twenty years later, Tim Berners Lee took inspiration from Nelson's vision, as well as other narratives like Vannevar Bush's [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex), to create the World Wide Web. Hypertext came to life.

</IntroParagraph>

But hypertext was only one small concept amidst a sea of ideas Nelson spent his life developing. Most were entwined in his grand vision of [[Project Xanadu]], a piece of software that at first glance looks similar to The Web we're currently on – a way to access and connect shared human knowledge. But Xanadu was more complex and nuanced. It centered around the principle of **"Parallel Documents, Visibly Linked"** – the proposed interface presented documents side-by-side, and included features like version control and [[Bi-Directional Links]].

<img
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1611093846/maggieappleton.com/notes/xanadu/transclusion_6_shrink.png"
    alt="Three pages of documents presented side-by-side, with colorful visible links between them"
/>

In the historical record, Xanadu is often framed as an alternative to The Web – "the web that could have been" – if it had ever shipped. Unfortunately its [complexity led to troubles](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/), and Berners-Lee's version of hypertext won out.

Despite the fact we're not currently browsing the Xanadu web, Nelson is still full of provocative, insightful ideas that never quite came to life – some that speak to many of the issues currently plaguing the modern web and are worth revisiting.

Two of the most intruiging are **Transclusion** and **Transcopyright**, a pair of concepts that reimagine the way authorship, attribution, copyright, and content monetization might work online.

## Transclusion

Transclusion is including one part of a document into another, and maintaing a link between the two. **This is different to copying.** A copy isn't inherently linked to it's original, and can be changed in the duplicate version.

A transclusion is directly linked to the original, and contains the exact same contents. Someone viewing the transclusion can easily open and view the original document. By doing this, transclusions create a single source of truth for that element, and a [[Bi-Directional Link]] so you can navigate between the original source and its instances across the web.

Now, what happens if the original source changes?

The transclusion doesn't automatically change along with it. If transclusions were direct embeds of the original content, we'd end up with [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot) on a whole new scale. Every document would be a sad compilation of 404's.

You've probably' seen this happen with images – `<img>` tags where the `src` element points to an original source URL are essentially embeds. If the original publisher deletes the photo, your image dissappears along with it.

Instead, a transclusion is more like a saved version of the original – a _cached_ snapshot of it at a moment in time. You can update that snapshot to a newer version if you want to, but it's not automatic. Even if the original author deletes it, your transcluded version stays visible.

It works the same way [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) does – it's a version control system that stores the state of a file at a particular point in time.

<img
    width="620px"
    alt="Two documents connected by a transclusion. Transclusions are the same content displayed in more than one location, visibly linked."
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1611093848/maggieappleton.com/notes/xanadu/transclusion_5_shrink.png"
/>

This idea is powerful in both the possibilities and horrors it could open up. It would allow us to always know where content came from, and see it in its original context. This is a capitvating promise in the age of post-truth informational relativism. We are constantly presented with isolated soundbites, quotes, and tweets that are divorced from the context they were created within.

It would create a more layered and nuanced form of hypertext – something we're exploring in the [[Digital Gardening]] movement. We could build accumulative, conversational exchanges with people on the level of the word, sentence, and paragraph, not the entire document. Authors could fix typos, write revisions, and push version updates that propogate across the web the same way we do with software.

On the flip side, we can also imagine transclusions that once held bible quotes linking back to pages that are now filled with fiery smut. This sort of bad behaviour is inevitable to some degree, but could be minimised through thoughtful design patterns that I'll touch on later. Cultivating strong social norms, making social reputation visible, and enabling community moderation are all potential tools for it.

## Transcopyright

Transcopyright is an extension of transclusion that begins to make this very interesting for attribution, copyright, and monetisation – we begin to see how this might evolve into a sustainable economic system.

If text is able to be endlessly embedded across the web in a way that leads back to a single source and a single publisher, you can theoretically pay that person for every instance of their content showing up on the web.

In this alternate web utopia, readers would pay small amounts for reading content on the web. These _micropayments_ need to be truly micro for this to work. We're talking fractions of a cent for an article, not the chunky level of $5-10 a month most Patreons and subscription services run at. The majority of that payment would then flow back to the original author.

<BasicImage
    width="1100px"
    alt="Two documents connected by a transclusion. Transclusions are the same content displayed in more than one location, visibly linked."
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1611093847/maggieappleton.com/notes/xanadu/transclusion_4_shrink.png"
/>

In this idealised utopia we obviously want to place value on sharing and curation as well as original creation, which means giving a small fraction of the payment to the re-publisher as well.

We should note monetisation of all this content is optional. Some websites would allow their content to be transcluded for free, while others might charge hefty fees for a few sentences. If all goes well, we'd expect the majority of content on the web to be either free or priced at reasonable micro-amounts.

There are a thousand open questions here about the logistics of how this would work. But I find it sad to conclude it's completely outside the realm of human imagination.

We now have the [Web Monetization API](https://webmonetization.org/) up and running, and inevitably the words "blockchain" and "cryptocurrency" might have to be involved here. I'm not brave enough to speculate beyond that.

## Designing Speculative Interfaces

What I am comfortable speculating about is how this might look and feel as a user experience. My immediate reaction to this conceptual pair was to try and grasp onto a more grounded version of it.

**What would this look like in a real interface?** What kind of visual representations and interactions would make this possible? How would I create a transclusion, or pay someone through transcopyright?

Let's play a design game and think this through.

Here's a snippet of text I lifted from a recent Wired article, [To Mend a Broken Internet, Create Online Parks](https://www.wired.com/story/to-mend-a-broken-internet-create-online-parks/) by Eli Parser:

<SimpleCard width="800px">

"There’s a problem of public imagination. Fixing our ability to connect and build healthy communities at scale is arguably an Apollo mission for this generation—a decisive challenge that will determine whether our society progresses or falls back into conspiracy-driven tribalism. We need to summon the creative will worthy of a problem of this urgency and consequence."

</SimpleCard>

I've copied and pasted the text from the article. You can click the link above to view it in context, but you're going to have to scan the entire page to find the section I copied this from – your browser isn't going to scroll you to the correct point or highlight the relevant text because it's not a very smart link 😕.

The original source also has no clue I've copied and pasted from it. Nothing on Wired's article shows how many people have linked to or quoted their article - it currently looks like this:

<ImageFrame
    src="https://p-ZmFjNlQ.b3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/geuoQpb4/d63e913c-dc63-4643-933f-e98d9b0368f7.jpg?v=15fe4f207f02029a4dbbb83471f6add0"
    width="800px"
/>

Which means we have absolutely no visiblity into who else on the web is responding to and building off this piece of writing. If other people have also copied and pasted this snippet of text, adding on their thoughts and ideas, we'll never know. <Footnote idName={1}>I'm not saying any of those responses are necessarily good or worth reading. They might all be crap troll comments. But I at least want some visual indication they exist. </Footnote> Unless we really go digging through pages of Google search result for it. Which we're certainly not going to without good reason.

**Transclusion** would make this whole scenario quite different. Let's imagine this again...

---

As I'm reading this article on Wired, perhaps small indicators show up next to each paragraph showing the number of times each it's been cited somewhere else on the web.

Below is a simple Figma mockup to demonstrate the idea. Try hovering over the number 8 here and clicking:

<FullWidthBackground>

<iframe
    width="880"
    height="760"
    src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FoRs8JnNMxNI3AZQhZslzlL%2FTranscopyright%3Fnode-id%3D1%253A6%26viewport%3D805%252C1447%252C1.084823489189148%26scaling%3Dmin-zoom"
    allowfullscreen
></iframe>

</FullWidthBackground>

An overlay appears with links to those other transclusion instances. If we click on one of those links, we clearly want to see how this snippet of text fits into other contexts. Ideally, they would be {x links} that highlight the relevant text on the destination page and scroll you to the right position.

If we want to offer a more modular browsing experience, we could also have this link modal expand into the page itself.  
Try clicking on the first link in the transclusion list here:

<FullWidthBackground>

<iframe
    width="880"
    height="760"
    src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FoRs8JnNMxNI3AZQhZslzlL%2FTranscopyright%3Fnode-id%3D358%253A3%26viewport%3D319%252C700%252C0.5028579831123352%26scaling%3Dmin-zoom"
    allowfullscreen
></iframe>

</FullWidthBackground>

Showing the linked article inline allows us to stay within the current article, but also quickly check what discussions and narratives are happening around it – a feature that might help pop a few of our filter bubbles.

## Content Moderation and the Tradgedy of the Comments Section

Many people will react to this prototype with a justified sense of horror.

"If _anyone_ can link to _anything_ on the web and have it show up on the original, everything will devolve into anarchy!"

We can easily imagine transclusions going the way of the public comments section. The 14-year-olds of 4chan might mass-tranclude the introductory paragraph of a New York Times lead story, surrounded by the incendiary lyrics of South Park's '_Uncle Fucka_'. In fact that would definitely happen.

This system opens up all the gnarly philosophical questions around control, censorship, community moderation, and "_free speech_" that the web constantly makes tangible and visceral.

What we're after is a low-friction way for website owners to let other people link to their ideas and creations, offering a rich contextual reading experience for audiences, without letting bad actors monopolise the system.

**It goes without saying transclusions need to come with a permissions system.** Website owners might be able to include a single flag in their metadata that turns transclusions off. Something to the effect of:  
`<meta name="transclusions" content="disable" />`

A subtler approach would be to simply choose not to display transclusion links on their webpage. The equivalent of `transclusions { display: none; }` in a css file. In this scenario the transclusions would still exist, but wouldn't be as easy to access and read.

Simply reducing it to an on/off switch is a bit of a ham-fisted solution though. It leaves no room for nuance or spectrums of permissioning. Luckily, Ted Nelson baked this consideration into his original ideas.

Transcopyright is of course a **copyright** system, which means there's a variety of restrictions and rules about who can use a piece of content across different contexts. <Footnote idName={2}>As always, IANAL and actual lawyers should feel free to expand on this point and add informed nuance to the argument. I wish you could use transclusions to do so, but <a href="https://twitter.com/mappletons">Twitter</a> is sadly our best option at the moment.</Footnote>

<IntroParagraph>

When it comes to visionary, before-its-time software, it's hard to find a better archetype than Ted Nelson's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Project Xanadu</a>.

</IntroParagraph>

It's infamous in the technology community as a sixty-year project that never quite launched. A cautionary tale of what happens when you overhype, underdeliver, and try to stuff an operating system's worth of features into a single piece of proprietary software. The kind of tale that makes our ferociously lean startup culture of Move Fast, Break Things, and Demo or Die seem almost sensible.

Xanadu was a hypothetical hypertext system. <Footnote idName={1}>The word hypothetical is a bit strong. Many versions were built. There is a working demo showcasing a few of its features [here](http://xanadu.com/xanademos/MoeJusteOrigins.html). But there is no active version on the App Store or Product Hunt I can link you to.</Footnote>

It's hard to read the word _hypertext_ in 2021 and not believe its synonymous with the system Tim Berners-Lee built in 1989 – the World Wide Web that became so much more than linked text on digital screens. The version of hypertext you are reading this on is the only hypertext most of us have ever known.

And yet the idea of hypertext predates Berners-Lee by two decades. The term was coined in 1963 by none other than Ted Nelson as part of a much larger vision; one small brick in the grand Xanadu dream mansion. <Footnote idName={2}>While Nelson coined the word, the notion of linked documents goes back to Jorge Luis Borges The Garden of Forking Paths" in 1941 and Vannevar Bush's Memex machine in 1945 – both significant, named influences for Nelson. </Footnote>

To talk about Xanadu, we need to put a pin in our current understanding of _hypertext_. Our preconceived notions of what a link is, how it works, and what digital text is capable of threatens to overwrite the alternate history we're about to explore.

Ted hoped it would be a medium for "[serious electronic literature](https://xanadu.com.au/ted/XUsurvey/xuDation.html)" – a paradigm shift that would free us from the material constraints of paper. His vision was the first to meaningfully consider how storing information in digital bits could reconfigure the way we read, write, cite, and share words.

Xanadu's failure to mature into a widespread, useable commercial product is great fodder a [dramatic cover story](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/). One fuelled by the noticeably combative language in Xanadu's [documentation](https://xanadu.com/). "The computer world is a continual war over software politics and paradigms" where "we fight on" for "vindication" and "the last laugh." One feels like the dinner guest who has stumbled into a raging martial argument over unwashed tea towels. You don't dare ask for context.

Yet these historical skirmishes and financial flops are also the least interesting thing about Xanadu. The most interesting part is its **Pattern Language**.

## Architectural Pattern Languages

[[Pattern Languages]] are sets of flexible, reusable solutions to common design problems.

They come from the land of architects: the software developers of the material world. Namely, the architect [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander), whose philosophy of constructing vibrant and humane living space escaped the confines of urban planning and infused the world of software design in the late 1980's.

Alexander defined 253 architectural patterns for designing cities, towns, and homes. These became the example patterns for writing patterns. Each one is composed of a context, problem, example, and solution.

For example, the design pattern **A Place to Wait** asks that we create comfortable accommodation and ambient activity whenever someone needs to wait; benches, cafes, reading rooms, miniature playgrounds, three-reel slot machines (if we happen to be in the Las Vegas airport). This solves the problem of huddles of people awkwardly hovering in liminal space; near doorways, taking up sidewalks, anxiously waiting for delayed flights or dental operations or immigration investigations without anything to distract them from uncertain fates.

There's no single way to implement these design patterns. They are purposefully abstract enough to adapt to the situation at hand. Rules of thumb rather than sets of formulaic instructions.

## Xanadu as a Design Pattern

Taken as a collection of design patterns, Xanadu's documentation suggests solutions to some of the hypertextual problems we're wrestling with today;

-   How do we structure information and build relationships between pieces of data that help us see them across contexts, and clarify understanding?
-   How do we build systems that allow people to collaborate on shared documents without losing authorship? How do we credit and compensate authors based on their contributions?
-   How do we bring ideas and data from a variety of sources into conversation with our own, while leaving a clear trail back to the origin?

Xanadu became a sad parable, when it should have been a piece of speculative design. A set of seeds scattered into the wind for other people to pick up and plant, rather than the patent-happy industrial farming conglomerate it tried to grow into.

Curiously enough, there appear to be rogue seedlings sprouting around the web. A number of Xanadu's design patterns are showing up in modern manifestations. We're finding ways to backwards engineer the original spirit of Xanadu into the existing structures of the World Wide Web.

# The Patterns

1. Visible Links

Ted Nelson has many gripes, and **jump links** are one of his biggest. They're the kind of links we all use around the web today. Clicking a hyperlink is a bit of a gamble. It _jumps_ you into somewhere unknown. You find out when you get there.

We've found ways to adapt to this; Venkatesh Rao has a compelling exploration of the [rhetoric of hyperlinking](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/07/01/the-rhetoric-of-the-hyperlink/) that we use to hint at where people are headed. Most browsers will show you a URL preview, but they tuck them into the far corner in tiny text:

<img
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1623585337/maggieappleton.com/notes/xanadu/hover-preview-url_shrink_kxvwtp.png"
    width="1000px"
    alt="URL hover previews showing in the left hand corner of page"
/>

These can only tell you so much when modern URLs are often obscured by link shorteners and overstuffed with tracking queries. These solutions are only a band-aid on the underlying wound. They suggest where you're headed, rather than showing you.

Nelson's answer to jump links are **visible links** – links that show you the full context of where you're headed. These were an essential feature of Xanadu. In the original mockups for "_Xanadocs_" linked text would be connected to its source in a rather literal fashion: brightly colored highlights running between documents.

<ImageFrame
    width="1000px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1623916915/maggieappleton.com/notes/xanadu/xanadu_au17yq_shrink_tqkdxs.png"
    alt="One of the original UI mockups for a Xanadoc with visible links between text blocks"
    showalt
/>

This proposed solution relies on two other patterns – _parallel documents_ and _transpointing windows_ (covered below) – but the underlying principle was simply that links made their destinations clear.

In lieu of Xanadoc links, the modern web has landed on some fairly decent solutions to this issue: **hover previews and unfurls**.

**Hover previews** are when you can see a preview of the page you're headed to when you hover over a link. It's usually an excerpt that gives you the page title, the first few lines of text, and sometimes an image. Wikipedia was one of the first major sites to [add these](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/04/18/how-we-designed-page-previews-for-wikipedia/) in 2018.

<ImageFrame
    width="1000px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1000/v1592343673/maggieappleton.com/notes/Screenshot_-_2020-06-16_20.49.44.png"
    alt="Wikipedia's interface showing one of the hover previews that appear over links"
    showalt
/>

Hover previews have also become popular in the [[Digital Gardening]] community as a way to help visitors quickly navigate through collections of public notes and essays that are deeply interlinked. <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/">Andy Matuschak</a> and <a href="https://www.gwern.net/index">Gwern Branwen</a> are two gardeners with good examples of how these work in action.

Similar to hover previews, **unfurls** are the preview cards that automagically appear when you paste a link into Twitter, Facebook, Notion, Miro, or any other richly-featured web app. If I paste a link to this great article on [building a more honest internet](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/building-honest-internet-public-interest.php) into a Tweet or Notion document, it automagically displays the feature image, title, and byline without any extra effort from me:

    alt="Open graph previews appear in Notion when you paste a link and select 'Create Bookmark'"

This system is powered by the [Open Graph Protocol](https://ogp.me/) which Facebook introduced in 2010. This standardised format helps website authors define _metadata_ like titles, descriptions, authors, and images for each of their pages. These are automatically retrieved and "unfurled" when the link is pasted elsewhere on the web.

Both hover previews and link unfurls give you a good sense of where you're headed if you click on a link. They get us to _semi-visible_ links.

Previews aren't quite the same as physical links between parts of a page though. You lose the fine-grained associations between specific paragraphs and lines. If we wanted to dial up the Xanadu-esque visibility, we could work on showing previews of the whole page and directing people to specific pieces of text within it.

Side-by-side, interactive windows

Separate browser or application windows arranged side-by-side don't cut it

3. Transpointing Windows

5. Bi-directional Links

6. Version Control

In the age of Git, we tend to take version control for granted.

The first version control system dates back to [1975](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control#History). It's now difficult to imagine programming without it.

7. Modular Text Blocks

The core building block of the web has always been documents. While the idea of a web*page* has evolved far beyond it's original idea, we still construct, connect, and navigate websites at the page level.

The early web was built for academic researchers to share their work, in a time before all the plebs invaded with our bleeding-heart livejournal entries, dancing baby GIFs, and TikTok moves. These researchers designed the system to mimic their primary medium of communication; paper-based academic articles and documents.

This paper document design metaphor determined many of the early architectural decisions. URL addresses were set at the _page_ level, rather than the paragraph. Inline images were an afterthought, and even a contentious addition to the spec. <Footnote idName={3}>No one seriously considered the possibility of adding videos or animations. The presumption visual images are a impoverished medium for serious intellectual thought is a whole other kettle of fish.</Footnote>

Blocks construct documents

Notion pioneered this in the note-taking space

Explosion of note-taking apps using a block-first approach: Roam, Innos, Clover, Craft, Kosmik

8. Stable, Universal Addresses

The web enforces addresess on the document level rather than the block level

No stability at all, link rot everywhere

URL queries and subpaths

Roam block UIDs

9. Annotation

Google docs comments

10. Multiple Views and Spatial Arrangements

Graph previews are a weak version of this

Notion linked databases that offer various view types

Most modern dashboards offer multiple ways to view data

ZigZag format

11. Micropayments

The original Xanadu vision was ambitious. Unreasonably ambitious. The above feature list is a small selection.

Perhaps you sense the problem.  
Solving all the things all at once gets tricky.

Instead, what we're now seeing is the ad-hoc, decentralised manifestation of Xanadu in bits and pieces.

People are building Xanadu without knowing what Xanadu is.  
Which is the essence of a good pattern language; true patterns evolve naturally within systems, and are found rather than crafted. <Footnote idName={4}>Christopher Alexander's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_Order">The Nature of Order</a> goes deep on this principle</Footnote>

In the grand scheme of things, 60 years isn't an extraordinary amount of time to spend solving a problem. It's about 0.09% of history since humans first started creating symbolic cultural artefacts <Footnote idName={5}>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_La_Pasiega">La Pasiega Cave</a> in Spain as a relative marker - 65,000 y.a.</Footnote>

Who knows, maybe Xanadu can still happen (if you clap for it) ✨

I've been a [cellular agriculture](https://www.new-harvest.org/cell_ag_101) and [cultured meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultured_meat) enthusiast for a couple of years now. If you've never heard of cultivated meat, my [illustrated notes](/meat-planet) on the fantastic book **Meat Planet** will get you caught up.

The TLDR is we've found a way to grow meat without killing animals. You can see why this might be intriguing.

At fifteen I read [Fast Food Nation](https://www.librarything.com/work/3735), [The Omnivore's Dilemma](https://www.librarything.com/work/504173), and [Stuffed and Starved](https://www.librarything.com/work/3657642) in quick succession. That was sadly the end of enjoying [hawker stall chicken rice](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/a-brief-history-of-hainanese-chicken-rice-singapores-national-dish/).

In the 14 years since, I've maintained various levels of Really Bad veganism. <Footnote idName={1}>The highly flawed and non-judgemental variety. I have no interest in policing your personal plate. </Footnote> Which is the state of knowing all the facts, understanding their moral implications, and still only making the "right choice" about 82% of the time.

Because here's the thing; [given the statistics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237464/share-of-vegans-in-the-united-states/), individuals voluntarily choosing to be vegan, and/or putting enourmous effort into convincing other people into veganism is a terrible game plan for addressing the complex, wide-ranging problems of animal agriculture:

Rather than judgementally guilt-tripping people into making _hard sacrifices_, exploring alternative ways of making meat (and meat-alternatives that aren't sad lumps of tofurkey) feels like a better use of everyone's time.

The thriving industry of cultured meat and cellular agriculture agrees. Research organisations like the [Good Food Institute](https://www.gfi.org/) and [New Harvest](https://www.new-harvest.org/) have been promoting, funding, and supporting new companies in this space over the last few years.

Keen to get involved, I talked my way into sketchnoting the 2019 [New Harvest conference](/newharvest2019) at the MIT Media Lab.

The conference work led to a new initiative with New Harvest; illustrating a series of podcast episodes around their impressive community of [research fellows](https://www.new-harvest.org/current_research_projects).

The [Cultured Meat and Future Foods Show](https://anchor.fm/futurefoodshow/) interviewed each research fellow. For each episode I made a one-shot illustrated summary that explains their research focus.

<IntroParagraph>

The term **tools for thought** has become a new rallying point over the last few years. People who might otherwise gather around keywords like _personal knowledge management_, _networked thought_, _productivity_, or _knowledge work_ are reframing their work.

</IntroParagraph>

The phrase appears on the landing page of every hot new note-taking app:

{screenshots here}

The phrase was first used by Kenneth Iverson in their 1979 paper [Notation as a Tool for Thought](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pdf). Howard Rheingold picked it as the title of their 1985 book [Tools for Thought](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/tools-thought) – a speculative history of how computing might unfold throughout the 1990's.

[Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) and [Michael Neilson](https://michaelnielsen.org/)'s 2019 essay on [transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/) helped kick off the new popularity wave, as well as Andy's [continued research](https://www.patreon.com/quantumcountry) and writing advocating for TFT as a field.

There's something odd in the way people are currently using the term though.

If we take the phrase at face value, as anything that helps humans think different kinds of thoughts, the list of historical examples should certainly include:

-   Written language
-   Hindu-arabic numeral system
-   The Socratic Method
-   The Scientific Method
-   Data visualisations
-   Spreadsheets
-   Cartesian coordinates

All of these things pre-date digital computers by at least a few hundred years (if not thousands).

## Current Patterns in Interactive Programming Games

#### 1. Location and Destination

The learner should always know where they are on the learning path, and what their destination is.

This one isn't specific to visual programming – it's a well-established principle of UX design that people need to know where they are, where they've been, and where they're headed.

Making this clear with a visual progress bar is common on learning platforms when we're trying to coax people through the long, hard journey of learning a new programming language or framework. It helps keep them motivated and feel a sense of regular progress.

<Draft />

---

#### 2. Embodied Space over Symbols

Instead of one-dimentional abstract symbols and signs, use our embodied understanding of up, down, left, right, front, and back to map concepts to two-dimentional space.

#### 3. Immersive Focus

#### 4. Invitation to Explore

#### 5. Direction Connections

Create a direct, instant association between syntax commands and their effects

This is very similar to Bret's 'Read the Vocabulary'

In traditional programming interfaces there's a significant lag between writing syntax, waiting for code to compile, and seeing the change in a browser or printed logs. It's often unclear what _exactly_ changed, and what part of the code changed it.

#### 6. Keep It In Context

#### 7. Cry for Help

#### 8. Revisit the Past

#### 9. Put it in Your Pocket

#### 10. Flow Over Time

#### 11. Compare and Contrast

#### 12. Brownie Points

#### Flexbox Froggy and Grid Garden

[Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) are built by [Codepip](https://codepip.com/) and both teach CSS layout techniques through live reactive demos. Every character you type into the code editor has an immediate reaction in the illustrated demo.  
This shortens the lag between action and reaction we usually have to deal with when waiting for code to compile, and makes it easier to figure out what each command does.

/>

The same company made [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) which takes a similar approach to teach CSS selectors. Every command you type instantly highlights what's being selected on the illustration.

/>

#### Vim Adventures

[Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/) uses the style of a platform game to help learners get comfortable with the essential commands of Vim. Making the metaphor of physical space more obvious by adding pathways and directions helps you think about Vim's interface as a spatial area instead of a regular linear text editor.

<IntroParagraph>

Just like a good seventeenth century English garden, this [[Digital Garden]] has two sides to it – the private and the public. Everything I post here first sprouts in my <a href="https://roamresearch.com">Roam Research</a> garden. <Footnote idName={1}>If you have never heard of Roam, first stop by Anne-Laure LeCunff's articles on <a href="https://nesslabs.com/roam-research">Roam for Metacognition</a>, and the more hands-on <a href="https://nesslabs.com/roam-research-beginner-guide">The Beginner’s Guide to Roam</a>. Otherwise the rest of this post will be completely bewildering.</Footnote>

<br />
While many digital gardeners choose to make their entire notes database public, I'm
a bit more reserved. The notes and thoughts I post here are closer to in-progress,
informal essays. Lightly edited collections of ideas instead of the raw words that
come to me as I parse through books, papers, podcasts, and subconscious thoughts.

</IntroParagraph>

Roam is where my unfiltered and unshaped thinking happens. It acts a place I can externalise my thoughts to see what I think, clarify those thoughts, and connect them together.

There are many names for systems like this; [second brains](/basb), [tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/), or [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) practices. Perhaps "intentional notetaking" sufficiently captures it.

My approach is heavily influenced by the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) system; a method that focuses on constructing a web of declarative, connected notes that act as building blocks for creative output. <Footnote idName={2}>If you are new to the idea of Zettelkasten, I strongly recommend you read the [introductory material](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/). Understanding this approach to knowledge work is far more profound and transformative than any app will ever be.</Footnote>
Sonke Ahren's [How to Take Smart Notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/) book, as well as [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/)'s [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) approach are both great introductions to the Zettelkasten ethos. I'm particularly taken with Andy's intepretation of it, and illustrated a summary of the _evergreen notes_ system in [[Growing the Evergreens]].

This TLDR is you focus on writing **atomic**, **declarative** notes in **your own words**. The titles of these "_Evergreen_" or "_Zettel_" notes are statements; things you believe based on what you've read and experienced in the world. Things like "**Naming is the hardest part of programming**", or "**Fitness culture has replaced religion in modern society**". You follow this up with a paragraph or two explaining the statement and any literary references that led you to that belief.

You then combine these Evergreen notes into sequences. Each note can belong to multiple lines of thought. Connecting them together easily allows you to create outlines for articles, papers, or other forms of knowledge work. By using this core collection of beliefs as a starting point to build arguments and logical conclusions, you're never faced with a blank page. Realisations emerge from the bottom up.

#### Evergreens / Zettelkasten and Roam Research

There's plenty of hype and chatter about Zettelkasten systems in the Roam community. However, I haven't seen many walkthroughs of well-developed databases filled with Zettels. Two notable exceptions to this are [Joel Chan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6PIrVZoZAk) and [Beau Haan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoddCmn3eL0), both of whom have very thoughtfully mapped the qualities of a Zettelkasten into a Roam system.

Most other tutorials lack practical examples outside the realm of productivity and note-taking. They fail to show what a collection of real Zettels looks like, how they emerge from research, and how they connect together to lead to meaningful output.

I'm sharing my system here to put one more tangible example out into the world. I've been working with Zettels in Roam for over a year and have 150+ of them written <Footnote idName={4}>Which is still a meagre beginners pile compared to the [90,000](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-hubs/) Niklas Luhmann wrote over the course of his career. #ZettelGoals</Footnote>. They have helped me clarify my beliefs, synthesise my understanding of other people's work, see connections across many different texts, spot holes in my arguments, and guided my research. They feed into my digital garden notes, essays, and conference talks. While I am certainly not a decorated academic or prominent researcher, they serve my plebian needs as an everyday knowledge worker.

My system is not an ideal or universal template. It certainly has flaws I'm oblivious to and will learn over time. <Footnote idName={3}>If you notice potential flaws, I would love to hear your thoughts **only if** you've been working in a Zettelkasten for 6+ months and creating public-facing work with it.</Footnote> It may not fit what you want and need from a system. But taken with a grain of salt, this post may give you ideas for your own Roam-based Zettelkasten.

## A tour through the Evergreens

The easiest way to show you this system is to walk you through it. I've recorded a quick video tour here, but you can also find the written version below.

### Anatomy of an Evergreen Note

Zettels in my system are called **Evergreens**. Evergreens each have their own page. Their titles begin with the ✱ symbol and make a declarative statement – a single sentence that captures the main thesis.

The ✱ symbol <Footnote idName={5}>I paste this in with a keyboard shortcut. You can set this up with any text expander app like <a href="https://textexpander.com/">TextExpander</a> or <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a></Footnote> allows me to quickly search my database for Evergreens using the navigation bar and immediately have my results filtered for only Evergreens

<img
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1625430358/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/search_shrink_z8uiar.png"
    alt=""
/>

The primary links to these notes are all kept on a single page called (appropriately) _Evergreens_. They're roughly grouped into large themes that my work centres around; design, embodied cognition, visual explanations, cultural anthropology, technology, economics, education, etc.

<ImageFrame
    width="900px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1625407664/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/evergreens-page_ply6mc.png"
    alt="Screencapture of my evergreen notes page showing a selection of the notes"
/>

The order of the notes isn't critically important, but I generally try to arrange them as threads of an ongoing conversation. Each new Evergreen note continues or builds off a train of thought already emerging on the page.

The numbers to the right of each Evergreen are block references – they counts the number of times I've connected that Evergreen note to another one. I'll expand on how that works a bit later on.

Inside each of these Evergreens, I add the _"Evergreens"_ tag as a top-level reference. This makes it possible to search Evergreens with queries elsewhere in my database. Under that I expand on the main thesis in 2-3 paragraphs. I then have sections for _Literature Notes_, _Fleeting Notes_, related tags, and _Branches_.

Here's two examples of what a fully fleshed Evergreen looks like in my system:

<ImageFrame
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1625406589/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/evergreen-expanded_ortnoy.png"
    alt="Screenshot of an evergreen note about infrastructures in Roam that includes a title, body, literature notes, fleeting notes, related tags, and branching notes"

<ImageFrame
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1625428508/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/evergreen-exp-2_shrink_jdfbjq.png"
    alt="Screenshot of an evergreen note about cultural abnormality in Roam that includes a title, body, literature notes, fleeting notes, related tags, and branching notes"
/>

Seeing these hopefully gives you a more tangible understanding of what Evergreens look like. Let's break down each section in more detail:

**Literature notes** link to any books or articles that led me to this belief or realisation. I keep book notes on their own page while articles, podcasts, and video lecture notes live on daily notes pages. I add either the page reference or the block reference to each literature item, then nest block references to specific relevant notes under it. This allows me to see where I first stumbled upon the idea, and open up a full set of notes on the text if I want to find connected ideas. This is usually where Evergreens begin; I come across an idea in something I'm reading or researching that resonates.

**Fleeting notes** are where I put my loose and scattered thoughts on the topic. They're the scratch pad area where I try to figure out what the Evergreen is about, phrase the idea in different ways, and add examples of where I see the principle applied in real life. These are written alongside literature notes; they're my immediate reactions to the idea that help me figure out why I find it interesting, expand on it, and phrase it in my own words.

The **Related to** section is where I add any topic tags. This is useful for querying your notes later on. For example if I want to find evergreens related to _Infrasturcture_ or _Gender Norms_ while I'm writing an essay later on, I can construct a query for '_Evergreens_' + '_Gender Norms_' and find what I need.

**Branches** are what connect different Evergreen notes together. These are block references from the main _Evergreens_ page. To create these, I find Evergreen notes that are related to the note I'm currently creating. I then copy the **block reference** that holds the Evergreen on the main page, and paste it under _Branches_.

<ImageFrame
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1625433040/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/blockref-2_shrink_ke5fgr.png"
    alt="Diagram showing a note on the main evergreens page being block referenced under the branches tab of an evergreen note"
/>

This might seem odd to do. Why create a block reference instead of just putting a link to the Evergreen page in?

This trick creates a _different type of link_ to a page reference. It makes it easier to see chains of related Evergreens. If we now go to our Evergreens page and click on the number next to each Evergreen note, it opens up a condensed view of all the notes I think are related to this one:

<ImageFrame
    width="850px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1625434315/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/branches-2_clqmx4.png"
    alt="Screencapture showing the block references under an Evergreen expanded to reveal all the related notes"
/>

Arranging Evergreens in this format allows us to build multiple chains of conversation between notes, and quickly reference them when we're trying to outline own our essays, talks, or original creations.

## Working in a Constantly Evolving System

I started writing this post back in March of 2020 after I did a tour of my Roam database with [Rob Haisfield](https://robhaisfield.com/about). Rob has been hosting a [series on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWA6aNcUjK2w0Z_-0UURq_g/videos) where Roamers walk through their databases showing all the ways they've adapted the system to their particular needs. <Footnote idName={6}>These are essentially a COVID-friendly version of <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAnnaGat/status/1264172874304290816">MTV Cribs</a> for personal knowledge management nerds. Conspicuous consumption in the age of sense-making knowledge work.</Footnote>

Here's the original video tour:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXXXHN516qc

My system has changed significantly since I did this walkthrough tour, but it covers a lot of the same concepts I outlined above. My philosophies haven't changed, only my implementation methods.

I mention in the video that I expect my Roam system to evolve over time. I still think that's true.

Thanks to the thriving <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/roamcult">#roamcult</a> community, building and tending my Roam space has become a glorious exercise in knowledge management, experimental workflows, and collective problem solving.

There is no _one way_ to use Roam. Seeing the wide diversity of systems Roamers build is the whole point. It's a grand communal experiment.

---

## Page Prefixes

I have a handful of page prefixes that help me distinguish between page types. I use Roam's [namespaces](https://roamstack.com/kb/basics/working-with-namespaces/) feature for these which allows me to prefix pages with full words, but collapse these into shorter letters:

-   Books/
-   Courses/
-   Projects/
-   ✱ for Evergreen notes
-   ⍜ for research questions
-   ⌆ for speculative outlines of original creations
-   ➽ for original creations themselves – drafts that are/will be public at some point. Essays, <a href="/garden">digital garden notes</a>, conference talks, video tutorials, and livestream/podcast outlines all fall under this umbrella

These are handy for quickly searching for a certain type of note - the prefix lets you quickly scan through all your books/projects/Evergreen from just the inline search system

<p>
    It also means you can create multiple pages with the same title, but of
    different types.
</p>

<p>
    For example, <b>Book/ Meat Planet</b> and <b>➽ Meat Planet</b> are two
    different pages in my database. One is my notes on the book{" "}
    <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520295537/meat-planet">
        Meat Planet
    </a>
    , and the second is a planning and draft-writing space for an <a href="/meat-planet">
        illustrated essay I made
    </a> that took what I learned from the book and expanded it into an original
    creation.
</p>

---

## Keyboard Maestro

<p><a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> is the salt to my digital kitchen. Combining it with anything makes the original better.  This holds true for Roam.

It's an app that helps you write <b>macros</b> - tiny automated sequences of events on your machine – within a pleasantly visual interface.</p>

<ImageFrame src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1590954520/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/keyboardmaestro.png" />

This includes opening applications, typing text, clicking buttons, rearranging windows, etc.

Within the context of Roam, I find it handy for three things:

### 1. Capturing Links

Whenever I find an article, academic paper, podcast, or video I want to save, I'm able to hit a specific hotkey that snaps up the page title and URL, then formats it into Roam-friendly markdown link.

<ImageFrame src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1590959288/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/linkcapture.gif" />

I also have it set to auto-magically add specific tags to the end based on the type of link. So **Ctrl + A** tags it with **#Article**, and **Ctrl + V** tags it with **#Video**, etc.

<br />

### 2. Auto-Opening Windows

I have two hotkeys setup that make opening Roam frictionless. One opens it as a new window, and another opens it as a new tab to the right.

<ImageFrame src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1590958542/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/quickopen.gif" />

<br />

### 3. Templating

To help keep my data base consistent, I have a set of pre-written templates I can pop into different kinds of pages - daily notes, books, projects, evergreen notes, etc.

These add sets of metadata into the front that make it easy for me to query pages later on.

<ImageFrame src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1590959251/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/templates.gif" />

You can use any snippet-expander app for this, such as Alfred, or TextExpander.

### Feel free to grab these macros for yourself:

## Note Taxonomy

Here's a big picture map of my taxonomical landscape.
 -->

## Open Note Streams

I like keeping an **open stream** that runs from source material to Roam to this digital garden. It's always flowing.

The open stream means the reading, note-taking, reflecting, developing ideas, and publishing process is a continuous repeating cycle. Not a linear pipeline.

Instead of reading a whole book. _Then_ importing the notes. _Then_ highlighting and reflecting on them. _Then_ crafting a summary. _Then_ uploading the "finished work" to the internet, I instead do all of those at once. **In very small chunks.**

<p>
    Let's take a book I'm currently reading,{" "}
    <a href="/making-anthropology">Making by Tim Ingold</a>.<br /> My stream of
    notes on it currently lives in three places simultaneously.
</p>

First, <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> app is where I capture book notes when I'm away from my desk (Roam's quick capture feature isn't its strong suit).

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1590778121/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/bookflow_1.png" />

It's nice and simple, and always perfectly syncs between my iOS devices and the desktop app.

I read on my phone (because I'm an awful person). While out walking around (because I'm a truly awful person). Or in the evening on my iPad. All my books are on Kindle or in PDFs<Footnote idName={2}>I use <a href="https://pdfexpert.com/">PDF Expert</a> solely for it's 'reading mode' feature.</Footnote>

<Arrow />

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1590778119/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/bookflow_2.png" />

I transfer notes from Drafts into Roam every few days. This gives me the chance to link up related concepts, bold key points, highlight _really key_ points, and start collecting Evergreen Notes & Key Concepts at the top of my note.

I've also become a convert to the church of **Taking Notes in Your Own Words**. I still copy and paste key quotes, but I try to rephrase and rewrite ideas in my own terms as much as possible. Doing this just makes synthesising much easier and faster. It also helps me think. Which is the point of this entire note-taking carnival.

<Arrow />

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1590778119/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/bookflow_3.png" />

As my Roam notes develop, I transfer chunks of them over to my public notes on the book <a href="/making-anthropology">which you can read here</a>. You will notice they're fairly loose. Every time I add more notes onto the end I lightly clean up the earlier sections and update the "last tended" date.

The idea is that by the time I finish reading a book, I've already done the majority of my thinking, reflecting, writing, and synthesising on it. And created a readable summary n+1 other people might find helpful.

<p>
    I also like that the system allows me to take my sweet time with a book. I
    can read it deeply, think about it properly, and let my notes on it mature
    without ending up with a huge backlog of them.

<AppQuestion />

I get asked this question at least once a day on Twitter. People are always keen to hear what tools I use to make illustration. It's frankly daft it's taken me this long to just write a note about it rather than answering a thousand people individually.

## I'm a Promiscuous Polytooler

I use wide variety of different tools and apps for different kinds of visual creations. I'm not wedded to any one tool in particular – they all have their strengths and weaknesses.
I'll use whatever fits the task at hand and move work between them liberally.

Here's all the apps and hardware that might be involved in a particular creation...

<br />

And here's a couple of my common workflows for different styles of illustrations and visuals...

## 1. Illustrated notes

Anything I make that has a painterly and loose hand-drawn feel was made in Procreate on the iPad or Photoshop on the Wacom Cintiq. Or probably a combination – it's easy to move files back and forth between the two and the tools they offer are very similar.

Illustrations like these...

<TwoColumn divwidth="550px">

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621767637/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools/Photo_by_Maggie_Appleton_on_June_30_2019._htaur3.jpg" />

</TwoColumn>

<BasicImage

/>

Both of these applications allow you to draw in "raster" graphics, meaning you paint pixels onto a canvas. They require a decent level of hand-skills to make sure your lines aren't wobbly, although both applications have smoothing features to help with that.

When I'm in Procreate I use a small selection of brushes I've gathered over the years. It's hard for me to remember where they're all from, and I've customised the majority of them to suit my personal prefs. Most of them were originally from Max Ulichney's [MaxPacks](https://maxpacks.com/) brushes. I have the essentials set ($2), the painters set ($8), and the comics set ($15), and can vouch they're all great.

<ImageFrame

    alt="A screenshot of my iPad with Procreate open and my brushes panel displayed"
/>

I move these pieces to Photoshop if I want to work on a larger screen, or have accidentally enlarged the canvas to a 14000px wide sprawling set of sketches that Procreate can't open without crashing.

<ImageFrame
    width="1100px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1621764627/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools/PhotoshopSnap_bduk6w.png"
    alt="A screenshot of my Photoshop setup"
/>

## 2. Polished vector illustrations

Illustrations that look more "polished" are made primarily in Adobe Illustrator, with a touch of Photoshop at the end for lighting effects and texture.

Pieces like these...

<img
    alt=""
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621768811/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools/Linearnotes_shrink_gwvih5.png"
/>

These illustrations are all vector-based, meaning we use mathematical curves to define their shapes, rather than painted pixels. Vectors are great for create hard, crisp edges and working with perfect geometric forms.

<ImageFrame
    width="1100px"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1621769123/maggieappleton.com/notes/tools/gatsby-illustrator_l37kgv.png"
    alt="A screenshot of my Adobe Illustrator setup with one of my illustrations on the canvas"
/>

While I love vectors for laying down the foundation shapes of these, I'll move them over the Photoshop once they're 90% done to adjust the colors, add more subtlety to the lighting and shadows, and chuck a bit of texture on the top so they feel more tangible.

I've been seeing an increasing amount of baby pink on developer Twitter.

In lieu of the hooded figures in dark rooms, boxy hardware, and streams of neon green characters that we traditionally associate with code nerds and computer geeks, there's been a sudden influx of pastel shades and baby animals.

It's an aesthetic that feels like walking into a Sailor Moon episode. Bright, sparkling rainbows and unicorns waft by a soft pink backdrop. Everything looks like a puffy, dusted marshmallow.

</TwoColumn>

For lack of a better term, I'm calling this style "_femme dev_."
To be clear, by _femme_ I don't mean "for women." I mean it in the sense of celebrating a traditionally feminine aesthetic.

Sex (man / woman) is [not the same](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction) thing as gender (male / female). If you're not familiar with gender theory, [Judith Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Trouble) is a good introduction.

_Feminine_ and _masculine_ are socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes. The way we walk, talk, sit, dress, and decorate our laptops all have the potential to be '_read_' as either masculine or feminine by those around us. Or somewhere in between. It's all a big fuzzy spectrum.

Our ideas about what reads as feminine or masculine is fluid and culturally relative. These roles are constantly shifting and changing under our feet. We have only associated the color pink with femininity for the last 100 years <Footnote idName={1}>Good read by The Atlantic on this - [Pink Wasn't Always Girly](https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/08/pink-wasnt-always-girly/278535/)<br/>"In the 18th century, it was perfectly masculine for a man to wear a pink silk suit with floral embroidery"</Footnote>, and it's reasonable to expect that in 100 years time we'll once again attach arbitrary color associations to arbitrary gender roles.

But given our current historical moment, it's fair to say the aesthetic on display here draw on an established history of traditionally feminine visual styles. By no stretch of the imagination does that mean it is designed just for women, or off limits to men.

It simply means it's made for anyone who enjoys the aesthetics of soft, puffy Kirby plushies and sparkle text.

Amy Wibowo who runs [bubblesort.io](https://shop.bubblesort.io/) is one of the folks at the centre of this fuzzy, adorable shift. Their zines, keyboard designs, and sweatshirts bring an intentionally femimine vibe to an industry overwhelmingly staffed by self-identifying males. <Footnote idName={2}>An unsurprising 91.1% male according to 2020's State of JS [survey](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/demographics/gender) </Footnote>

Since keyboards are one of the only pieces of 'kit' developers use in their jobs (other than 32" tall vertical displays), custom keycaps designs have become a central feature of this movement.

Considering the plethora of males in development, the rise of femme aesthetics is perhaps both curious and not.

## An eponymous law is a principle or rule named after a particular person

The programming community abundantly creates and embraces **Eponymous Laws.** Compared to other fields, the number of "unofficial" laws, principals, and rules of thumb considered cultural gospel is overwhelming.

Each law isn't simply a piece of unique knowledge or insight. They often have a backstory – the context of when and where it was created is signficant. Many of these laws were spawned at critical turning points in the history of computer programming. Some come from inside influential companies, or innovative collectives, or touchstone books. Each feels a small story woven into the mythology and cosmology of computational history.

They come with a social connection to their creators. Their legacy and social credibility adds weight and legitimacy to the principle itself.

<IntroParagraph>

At the end of last year I got to attend <a href="https://medium.com/mozilla-festival/tagged/mozfest2019">MozFest</a> here in London. Mozilla events are consistently extraordinarily in their format and coordination level. It's a thousand-person unconference that actually works.

</IntroParagraph>

The only issue is immense FOMO as you try to pick between attending a roundtable discussion on gendered voice assistants, a panel on _The Algorithmic Gaze_, or a debate on _The Future of Disinformation_. You can browse through the overwhelming variety of sessions they ran <a href="https://public.zenkit.com/c/2RH604FcHf/schedule?v=LK9b3laIX&hide=workspaceLists">here.</a>

---

One of my favourite sessions was on **Data Unions and the Future of Data** with speakers from [Streamr](https://streamr.network/) and the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/)

I hadn't encountered the concepts of [Data Unions](https://medium.com/streamrblog/what-are-data-unions-how-do-they-work-which-ones-can-i-use-887e67fb7716) and [Data Trusts](https://medium.com/@anoukruhaak/data-trusts-why-what-and-how-a8b53b53d34) before. While we're all acutely aware of the current economic-internet-clusterfuck where we seem to pay nothing for services, and invisibly hand over valuable data, you don't often hear reasonable solutions to the problem.

Other than some vague mumblings about blockchain that are swiftly followed up with an offer to buy into an ICO...

I'm broadly interested in the idea of what [[Local, Artisan Data Storage]] might look like.

I sketched out some notes during the session which should give you a general idea of the model. I can't speak to any of the technical aspects or feasibility of this, but the concept is intriguing.

A growing collection of all my favourite Neologisms.

These are freshly coined words or phrases inching their way into common usage, but not fully mainstream yet. Neologisms emerge when we are unable to express or conveniently refer to an emerging collective idea or experience.

They're **acts of creativity** as we fill the gap between our symbolic understanding of the world and our documented language.

#### Brahmin Left

"The “left” has become the party of the intellectual elite (Brahmin left), while the “right” can be viewed as the party of the business elite (Merchant right). In India’s traditional caste system, upper castes were divided into Brahmins (priests, intellectuals) and Kshatryas/Vaishyas (warriors, merchants, tradesmen). To some extent the modern political conflict seems to follow this division."

The term is a riff off the anthropological concept of **Cargo Cults** - a phenomenon in early 20th century Melanesian communities where people began to perform religious-like rituals hoping to summon modern technological goods.

They were often island communities who had previously been brought cargo-loads of foreign supplies by European colonisers.

In times of short-supply, communities would build symbolic totems like airplane runways, steamship docks, warehouses, and radio masts out of timer and straw. In the hopes of attracting the airplanes and ships that had once showed up with excesses of material wealth onboard.

<Subtext>
    
Notes (mostly to myself) on how the CSS <b>position</b> property works because I <i>constantly</i> forget.

</Subtext>

Having control over where elements are positioned on a webpage is essential for building [scrollytelling](https://medium.com/nightingale/from-storytelling-to-scrollytelling-a-short-introduction-and-beyond-fbda32066964) stories. We have to understand exactly how elements will behave within the layout, especially in relation to the scrollbar and viewport.

The `position` property determines where an element appears on the page. Sounds simple. But it also includes how an element relates to its parent element, the browser window, how it behaves on scroll, and whether placement properties like `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` and `z-index` will have any effect.

## **Position** can have six possible values

### 1. Static

`static` is the default value for elements. They stick to the normal page flow and placement properties (top, left, z-index, etc.) don't have any effect.

 <Center>

<StaticCSSPosition />

 </Center>

{" "}

<Spacer />

### 2. Relative

`relative` keeps the element in the normal document flow, but allows us to use placement properties. This means we can move the element up, down, left or right, relative to where it would have been in the normal document flow.

For example, if we nudge this box `-10px` up, and `-10px` to the left, it moves to here:

 <Center>

<RelativeCSSPosition />

 </Center>

In our CSS we would just need to declare a `relative` property on our box, then add `top` and `left` properties:

```css
.redBox {
    position: relative;
    top: -10px;
    left: -10px;
}
```

{" "}

<Spacer />

### 3. Absolute

`absolute` removes the element from the normal document flow. It places itself on an absolute position relative to the whole document.

The position of the parent has no influence on where the child shows up. Placement values like `top` and `left` are calculated relative to the document.

Declaring `position: absolute`, `left: 10px` and `bottom: 20px` on this `.redBox` element would position it 10 pixels from the left and 10px from the bottom of the document.

<Center>

<AbsoluteCSSPosition />

</Center>

<br />

#### **Relative Parents and Absolute children**

If you declare `position: relative` on the parent element, and `position: absolute` on the child, it now positions itself relative to the parent.

This is useful for creating overlapping elements.

<Spacer />

### 4. Fixed

`fixed` is similar to absolute, but sticks itself to the viewport rather than the document. Fixed elements don't move when you scroll down the page - they are always visible.

Fixed is useful for persistent elements like navigation bars or menus.

Declaring `position: fixed;`, `top: 10px;` and `right: 10px` on an element will position it 10 px from the top and right-hand side of the browser viewport. The rest of the document scrolls behind it.

<Center>

<FixedCSSPosition />

</Center>

#### **Annoying Transform Quirk**

If any parent element has a `transform: translate()` property declared on it, `fixed` won't work.

<Spacer />

### 5. Sticky

`sticky` makes an element "stick" to the viewport when it reaches a certain point – usually when the top of the viewport hits the top of the element.

It behaves like a `relative` element until it hits the sticking point, and then becomes `fixed`.

For sticky to work, the parent element needs to have the `relative` property declared.

<Spacer />

### 6. Inherit

`inherit` forces an element to inherit the position property of its parent. This wouldn't otherwise happen as `position` doesn't flow down the cascade.

In that spirit, I've gone all-out on customising the CSS that controls how my Roam looks.

I've used colors and font weight to distinguished internal from external links, added custom colors to particular page names, and shifted the contrast and spacing of elements to fit my own design aesthetic.

<ImageFrame

<br />

<h2>How to Paint Roam Your Own colors</h2>

<p>
    Luckily, this is all fairly easy to do. Roam has a built-in system for
    customising how your database looks.
</p>

You first need to create a new page called `roam/css`.

<ImageFrame
    width="840px"
    alt="The roam search bar with roam/css entered"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1607173029/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_12.47.43.png"
/>

Once there, create a new code block by typing `/code` and selecting the block option.

<ImageFrame
    width="840px"
    alt="Entering /code into the empty page"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1607173035/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_12.48.46.png"
/>

Once the code block appears, set the language to `css` from the right-hand drop down menu.

<ImageFrame
    width="840px"
    alt="Selecting the code option from the code block dropdown menu"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1607173038/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_12.48.56.png"
/>

You're now ready to start customising the CSS of your Roam. Any CSS you enter into this new code block will be applied across your whole database.

To test if it's working, type `h1.rm-title-display span { color: salmon;}` into the box.  
The title of your new page should change to a lovely shade of salmon.

<ImageFrame
    width="840px"
    alt="The page title changing to the color salmon"

## Pre-made Roam Themes

For those of you entirely uninterested in learning CSS who just want to pop a pre-made theme in, Roam has a whole collection of [pre-made themes](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fJRcVITNY) you can pick from.

Copy and paste any of them into your new `roam/css` page and the styles will be applied across your whole database

If you want to use my theme **Leyendecker**, the most up-to-date version is avaliable this [Github repo](https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes/blob/master/leyendecker.css). There's a older version listed on the [Roam database](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fJRcVITNY).

## Custom Styling Tags and Page Links

Another neat trick I love with CSS and Roam is creating specific styles for different page title and tags. <Footnote idName={3}>Shoutout to fellow Roam user <a href="https://malcolmocean.com/">Malcolm Ocean</a> who lobbied for this as an official feature of the Roam interface. I found out how to do it digging around in their impressively <a href="https://gist.github.com/malcolmocean/03d777a1c8f89be8c98e3d89d6821607">comprehensive CSS files</a></Footnote>

I have a little workflow taxonomy going that covers different kinds of output and the stages they flow through

<BasicImage

    alt="A screencapture of my Roam database with various colored tags"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_1457/v1590193543/maggieappleton.com/notes/datatags.png"
/>

We're able to do this because when we use the double bracket or add a # to create a page tag, Roam adds a new attribute to the HTML markup. If the page is made with a #, it adds a `data-tag` attribute. If it's made with double brackets Roam adds a `data-link-title` attribute

```html
<span data-tag="Ideas" class="rm-page-ref rm-page-ref-tag">
    #Ideas What if I learned how to chuck wood like a Chuck Norris woodchuck
    could?
</span>

<span data-link-title="Ideas" class="rm-page-ref">
    [ [Ideas] ] What if I learned how to chuck wood like a Chuck Norris
    woodchuck could?
</span>
```

We can then target both of those attributes with a CSS selector that looks like this:

```css
span.rm-page-ref[data-tag="Ideas"],
span[data-link-title^="Tweet"] .rm-page-ref {
    color: #fcb815;
    padding: 3px 4px;
    font-weight: 700;
    line-height: 1.4em;
}
```

The first selector, `span.rm-page-ref[data-tag="Ideas"]` changes any # link, and the second `span[data-link-title^="Tweet"] .rm-page-ref` selector changes any link made with [ [ brackets]]

It makes an enormous difference in your user experience to be able to quickly identify different block and note types through visual color association.

If you just want to grab the tag and page styles from my theme , scroll down to the bottom of my <a href="https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes/blob/master/leyendecker.css">CSS theme file</a> to find them.

## Block Level Styling

Roam also allows you to style whole blocks based on tags. <Footnote idName={4}>[Cato Minor](https://twitter.com/catominor3?lang=en) originally wrote a script for doing this in JavaScript, but now it's native to Roam's CSS.</Footnote>

In my database I use this heavily when taking book notes to visually distinguish between claims, responses, questions, and evidence.

To style an entire block, and all its child elements, we use:

```css
.roam-block-container[data-page-links*="Comment"] {
    // styles in here
}
```

To style only the child elements but not the parent, add `.rm-block-children` to the end use:

```css
.roam-block-container[data-page-links*="Comment"] .rm-block-children {
    // styles in here
}
```

To style just the block itself but none of the child elements, add `> div.rm-block-main` on:

```css
.roam-block-container[data-page-links*="Comment"] > div.rm-block-main {
    // styles in here
}
```

---

## Alternate Styling with Browser Plugins

If you don't want to use the native Roam CSS functionality, there's a way to apply custom CSS styles to any website using a browser plugin.

This is especially useful if you're part of a **multi-player** Roam where everyone has their own styling preferences.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
The idea of the **Cyborg** was born in 1960 in the thick of the US-Soviet Space Race, to two NASA consultants trying to solve the problem of keeping humans alive in the hostile conditions of outer space.

Nathan Kline and Manfred Clynes published a paper called '[Cyborgs and Space](http://www.guicolandia.net/files/expansao/Cyborgs_Space.pdf)' where they proposed that rather than trying to construct earth-like environments for humans to live in, we should try altering the humans themselves.

They imagined a _Cybernetic Organism_, or _Cyborg,_ that came with a built-in, self-regulating system that would take care of the bothersome issues of breathing, metabolism, sleep, circulation, and any other biological necessities, "leaving man free to explore, to create, to think, and to feel."

Creations often stray from their origins though.

The idea of the Cyborg has largely become a villainous character in science-fiction – used to explore the danger and discomfort we feel around our tools and systems. Let's just call this 'The Terminator Effect.'

Yet the idea has more philosophical promise and potential in it than Hollywood knows what to do with.

---

Anthropologist [Donna Haraway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Haraway) is a pioneer of using the term _Cyborg_ as an imaginative toy in her 1991 essay [The Cyborg Manifesto](/cyborg-manifesto). In Haraway’s writing, the Cyborg becomes a way to explore our cultural assumptions around the dividing lines between "nature" and "culture".

It offers us a chance to question the strict categories and historical boundaries _Western Cosmology_ <Footnote idName={1}>I use the term _Western Cosmology_ as a slightly tounge-in-cheek way of referencing the "_Western_" belief system.<br />Although we should acknowledge "_Western_" isn't really a thing, but can be interpreted as some generic mashup of [WERID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#WEIRD_bias), Euro-American, Judeo-Christian cultural ideals.<br />Language is flawed. I apologise for the sweeping generalisation.</Footnote> constructs for us. The firm divisions between humans / machines, natural / artificial, male / female, mind / body, fiction / reality, primitive / civilised, and science / society we are told most definitely exist. Despite the fact they are not in the least bit culturally universal.

Haraway’s insight is not only well ahead of her time, but also remarkably accurate as society now struggles to deal with technological relationships that contradict and question those historical divisions. They are all inherently tied to the issue of understanding where the line between organism and machine gets drawn. Or more accurately, the issue of there being a line at all.

---

Cognitive philosopher [Andy Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Clark) picked up on the idea of the Cyborg in his 2006 book [Natural-Born Cyborgs](/natural-born-cyborgs).

<IntroParagraph>

As a [[Digital Anthropology]] enthusiast and practioner-in-training, I'm often asked for reading recommendations that are are good entry points into the field.

</IntroParagraph>

I've compiled a list of gateway drugs.

This is a collection of books, talks, documentaries, articles, and academic paper that are a mix of "essential reads," plus some of my personal picks.  
It will give you a sweeping overview of what digital anthropologists tend to spend their time thinking about and researching.

Most of them aren't overly academic, so you don't need to worry about trugding through too much Foucauldian theory or references to Marxist [reification](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reification_(Marxism)>) (no promises though, sometimes it just comes out of left field).

<IntroParagraph>

Timelines are one of Greensock's power features. It turns you into an animation timelord. You could build out an animation made up of hundred of Tweens, and still have complete control and flexibility over the sequence, speed, and pacing.

Try doing that with CSS keyframes.

</IntroParagraph>

You can imagine my excitement when I discovered _nested timelines._ That's right, **timeline inception**.

You can put a timeline inside a timeline inside a timeline, and then hook them all up to a boss timeline. And then adjust the timing from the top down. We could even run the whole thing in reverse slow-motion.

## Building Timelines

The main method we'll need to combine timelines is `.add()`.

Let's say you have three mini timelines defined that you want to string together onto a main timeline:
`partOne`, `partTwo`, and `partThree`

We can add these onto a `mainTimeline` by using
`mainTimeline.add(partOne, partTwo, partThree)`

Not rocket science, right?

They're added in sequential order, so we could swap these mini timelines around with `mainTimeline.add(partThree, partOne, partTwo)`

Which really opens up the web animation medium for some experimental arthouse cinema non-linear narratives. We've clearly been missing out.

## The Position Parameter

Becoming a Greensock timelord requires you appreciate the power of the `position` parameter.

It allows us to control the start time of our tweens in the timeline.

It goes inside the Tween method, right after our target and variable object:

`gsap.to(target, variables, position)`

For example, my tomato Animation here will first turn this tomato to the colour plum. Then it will leave a 2 second gap

```js
const tomatoAnimation = gsap.timeline();

tomatoAnimation
    .to("#tomato", { color: "plum", duration: 1 })
    .to("#tomato", { color: "tomato" }, "+=2");
```

That's a _relative_ position.

We can also make it at the same time as the previous tween. This will play both of these tweens at the same time.

```js
tomatoAnimation
    .to("#tomato", { color: "plum", duration: 1 })
    .to("#tomato", { x: "100px" }, "<");
```

<IntroParagraph>

Using the [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/) web animation library (also known as gsap) in vanilla JavaScript isn't too complex. But when we want it to play nicely with a frontend framework like React, we run into some finicky issues.

</IntroParagraph>

This guide is specifically about using React Hooks with GreenSock, as many of the [existing guides](https://greensock.com/react/) only explain how to set it up with the old style of class components.

This isn't an introduction to the GreenSock library itself – head over to my post on [[The Bare Essentials of Greensock]] for that.

<br />

## React, Meet GreenSock

The issue with combining these two libraries is that React acts as a DOM interloper – it sits between the code we write and the DOM, managing it for us.

React builds it's own internal "tree" of DOM nodes based off our code, and only updates the actual DOM as needed (a concept previously known as the [[React Virtual DOM]]) <Footnote idName={1}>The React team has gone off the term of the _virtual DOM_ and prefer to talk about the _render tree_. Potatoes, potataos. For more on how the virtual DOM works, I have an [illustrated guide](/react-vdom)</Footnote>

<Halfspacer />

<BasicImage
    alt="A diagram of React generating all the DOM nodes for us"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1400/v1600973172/maggieappleton.com/notes/gsap/react-greensock-2.png"
/>

Meanwhile, the GreenSock library usually works by directly animating our DOM elements. Perhaps you can sense the tension in the room...

Since the GreenSock library needs access to the DOM in order to animate it, we need to tell React about our Greensock animations. Otherwise the two end up in awkward arguments that can end in tears (primarily mine).

<br />

## Bring in the React Hooks

There's two essential React hooks we'll use to connect our React code to our Greensock code: **useRef** and **useEffect**

<br />

<SimpleCard width="740px">

#### **useRef** lets us access and directly target our DOM nodes

</SimpleCard>

<SimpleCard width="740px">

#### **useEffect** lets us to perform side effects – any functions or data requests that we want to run _after_ rendering the component to the DOM

</SimpleCard>

If you're not completely comfortable with [React Hooks](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/beginners-guide-to-using-react-hooks/) yet and those technical explanations mean nothing to you, don't worry we're going to slowly walk through this. With illustrations. Because who the fork properly understands _"side effects"_?

---

### Getting Setup

We first need to run `yarn install gsap` or `npm install gsap` into our React project repo <Footnote idName={2}>**gsap** is short for _GreenSock Animation Platform_ and it's the way we reference the Greensock library in all our code sytax</Footnote>

<br />

<SimpleCard width="740px" center>

Feel free to open up a Codesandbox project to work through the steps while you read. I've set one up for you with React and Greensock already installed:

<p>
    <a
        noTip
        href="https://codesandbox.io/s/reacthooks-greensock-demo-xjoti?file=/src/AnimatedBox.js"
    >
        <button style={{ marginTop: "0.2em" }}>Jump into CodeSandbox</button>{" "}
    </a>
</p>

</SimpleCard>

<br />

### Building our Animation Component

Let's start by creating a React component called `<AnimatedBox/>` that is going to hold all our Greensock code. We're going to build a simple `<div>` element and have it animate across the page (exciting!).

We'll need to import the Greensock library into our component with `import { gsap }from 'gsap'`, as well as React and our two hooks with `import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'`

```js
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import { gsap } from "gsap";

const Animation = () => {
    return (
        <div
            style={{
                width: "160px",
                height: "160px",
                background: "salmon",
            }}
        />
    );
};
```

<p>
    I've set some basic width, height, and color CSS styles on our div to make
    it visible on the page.
</p>

<div
    style={{
        margin: "2em auto",
        width: "160px",
        height: "160px",
        background: "salmon",
        borderRadius: "4px",
    }}
/>

<Center>

Good looking div, right?  
Salmon is always the right color choice.

</Center>

---

## Adding the useRef Hook

We're now going to add _references_ to our animation with the **useRef** hook.

We create a new reference by adding `const boxRef = useRef()` anywhere outside of our return statement. Call it anything you like, but _boxRef_ is a good enough name for this example.

We then add a `ref={boxRef}` attribute on our `<div>` element.

```js
const Animation = () => {
    const boxRef = useRef();

    return (
        <div
            ref={boxRef}
            style={{
                width: "160px",
                height: "160px",
                background: "salmon",
            }}
        />
    );
};
```

This tells React we want to be able to control our `<div>` element with the `boxRef` reference once our component is mounted onto the DOM.

---

## Adding the useEffect Hook

Next we're going to add our **useEffect** hook, and write our GreenSock animation inside of it.

If you're already familiar with greensock this will look fairly straightforward.

```js
const Animation = () => {
    const boxRef = useRef();

    useEffect(() => {
        gsap.to([boxRef.current], {
            x: "400px",
            duration: 2,
        });
    });

    return (
        <div
            ref={boxRef}
            style={{
                width: "160px",
                height: "160px",
                background: "salmon",
            }}
        />
    );
};
```

We declare a normal `gsap.to()` tween, but instead of passing in an id or class name as the target element, we use `[boxRef.current]`.

This means we want gsap to animate the `.current` property of our `boxRef` reference – which is the `<div>` element we put that reference on.

```js
gsap.to([boxRef.current], {});
```

We then pass in our variables object, which tells Greensock to move our div 400px along the _x_ axis over a duration of 2 seconds:

```js
{ x: 400px, duration: 2 }
```

And thus, our div animates...

<p>

<Tween
    to={{
        scrollTrigger: {
            trigger: "#boxRef",
            start: "top 60%",
            end: "+=500",
            scrub: true,
        },
        x: "400px",
    }}
    duration={2}
    ease="back.out(1.3)"
>
    <div
        id="boxRef"
        style={{
            margin: "2em",
            width: "160px",
            height: "160px",
            background: "salmon",
            borderRadius: "4px",
        }}
    />
</Tween>

</p>

# Tada <span>🎉</span>

So by this point, you hopefully have a working animation in that [Codesandbox project](https://codesandbox.io/s/reacthooks-greensock-demo-xjoti?file=/src/AnimatedBox.js) or a local repo.

If you don't feel like mucking around with **useRef** and **useEffect**, [John Lindquist](https://johnlindquist.com/use-greensock-with-react-hooks/) created a simple React hook called **use-gsap** that hides them away.

<IntroParagraph>

When it comes to web animation libraries, [Greensock](https://greensock.com/) is the Rolls Royce of options. It's what powers most of those ridiculously fancy [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) websites.

</IntroParagraph>

<p>It's also been on my learning wish list for too long. I assumed it would be too complex. Everyone talks about how powerful the library is.

It's usually safe to assume powerful === complex.

But once I started digging in I realised the core of the library was actually quite easy to get the hang of. There's plenty of advanced mechanisms and complexity to get wrapped up in if you want to. But they're entirely optional.

This is a **one-scoop-plain-vanilla introduction to Greensock**.  
Without any sprinkles, nuts, or advanced functionality.</p>

<GsapScroller />

<Spacer />

<h3>Tweens</h3>

<p>
Tweens are the basic building blocks of a Greensock animation. A tween is a single transition – an element changing from state A to state B.

To create a tween, we target an _element_ (this can be any HTML element like a `<div>, <p>, or <svg>`) and pass in _variables_.
Variables define how the element should change over the course of the animation - whether it should move, change opacity or color, grow big or small – you get it.

Let's say we want to make a box go from navy blue to red, move 400 pixels on the X axis (horizontal), and grow in scale by 1.4 times the original:

</p>

<Center>

<TweenRedBigBox />

</Center>

```js
<div class="giantRedBox" background="navyblue" width="100px" height="100px" />;

gsap.to(".giantRedBox", 2, { x: 400, scale: 1.4, background: "red" });
```

<p>

Here's the code to do that in Greensock.

</p>

<p>

First we target the element using it's classname: `giantRedBox`.  
We then pass in a _duration_ that defines how long it should take the animation to move from state A to state B – here it's 2 seconds.  
Finally we pass in an object that contains our animation _variables_:  
`{ x: 400, scale: 1.4, background: 'red' }`

</p>

---

### Types of Tweens

There's three types of tweens:

<ul>
    <li>to</li>
    <li>from</li>
    <li>fromTo</li>
</ul>

In _to_ we define the final state of the animation – what it looks like by the end.
It begins in the position defined in our HTML & CSS, and moves _to_ the state we define inside our greensock tween.

```js
<div class="spinningBox" background="navyblue" width="100px" height="100px" />;

gsap.to(".spinningBox", 3, { x: 400, rotation: 360 });
```

<Center>

<TweenSpinningBox />

</Center>

<Spacer />

In _from_ we define the beginning state of the animation, and it moves back to it's state defined in the HTML & CSS

```js
gsap.from(".reverseSpinningBox", 3, { x: 400, rotation: 360 });
```

<Center>

<TweenReverseSpinningBox />

</Center>

<Spacer />

In _fromTo_ we declare two states we want the animation to move between.

```js
gsap.fromTo(".hotBox", 3, { background: "#93D0D9" }, { background: "#D93654" });
```

<Center>

<TweenBlueRedBox />

</Center>

---

### Timelines

Timelines are made up of tweens.
They group them together into a sequence.

Once we declare a timeline, we can chain sets of tweens onto it.

```js
const boxTimeline = gsap.timeline();

boxTimeline
    .to(".flyingBox", 2, { x: 100, scale: 1.5 })
    .to(".floatingBox", 3, { x: 10 })
    .to(".flippingBox", 1, { rotation: 360 });
```

---

You may see references around to multiple varieties of tweening and timelines called `TweenMax`, `TweenLite`, `TimelineMax`, and `TimelineLite`.

In late 2019 GSAP [updated to version 3](https://greensock.com/3-release-notes) and got rid of the all lite / max varieties so feel free to ignore that distinction in older code examples or.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
The site you're currently on is built in a JavaScript framework called [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). It's one of a host of new website builders based around [static site-generation](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/) and [the JAMStack](https://jamstack.wtf/) <Footnote idName={1}>JAM stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It's a relatively new approach to building websites that's been gaining popularity over the last half decade.</Footnote>

If you've heard of Gatsby before but haven't wrapped your head around it yet, this might be for you.

I already have some illustrated notes up on using the [[JAMStack with Gatsby & Contentful]] and [[Building Gatsby Themes]], but they're a little more advanced.

[Khaled Garbaya](https://khaledgarbaya.net/) just put out an egghead course on
[Getting Started with Gatsby](https://egghead.io/courses/get-started-with-gatsby) that's better suited to Gatsby beginners.

<a noTip href="https://egghead.io/courses/get-started-with-gatsby">

    />
</a>

## Illustrating the Key Concepts

I've been working on a set of illustrations that capture the _key concepts_ from Khaled's course. They don't summarise all the course content. They're just supporting material that help clarify the most important ideas.

First up is a **big picture view** showing all the essential parts of a Gatsby site.

<img
    alt="Gatsby is a collection of tools for building static sites"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1200/v1597741851/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/intro-gatsby/IntroGatsby_1_Small.png"
/>

Gatsby sites are able to pull in data from multiple sources all at once. This includes REST API endpoints, classic content management systems like [Wordpress](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/guides/wordpress/) or [Contentful](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2018-1-25-building-a-site-with-react-and-contentful/), or just your local file system.

These are pulled in through [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.com/), which acts as a _transportation layer_.

[Node.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/node/) is the main engine inside a Gatsby site which generates the pages, nodes, and metadata.

And finally [React](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/react/) creates all the user interface elements.

---

### Page Queries vs. Static Queries

Once people wrap their heads around the structure of a Gatsby project, GraphQL is usually one the first sticking points.

If you've never worked with it before, the syntax looks very odd and it's hard to tell what it's doing.

It gets more confusing to learn there are _two types of queries_ - **page queries** and **static queries**

<img
    alt="Diagram of a pageQuery request inside a page, and a static query request inside a component"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1597741854/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/intro-gatsby/IntroGatsby_2_Small.png"
/>

It only seems complex on the surface, but it's easy to distinguish these two. Most of your queries will be page queries – these live inside your page files like `blog.js` or `about.js`

Static queries go inside individual component files like `Navbar.js` or `Footer.js`. There's also a handy React hook to handle these for us: [useStaticQuery](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/use-static-query/)

---

### Progressive Enhancement

One of the main benefits of a Gatsby site is it uses a technique called **Progressive Enhancement** to render pages.

<img
    alt="Animation of a page rendering static HTML elements first, then being updates with React afterwards"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1597741856/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/intro-gatsby/IntroGatsby_3_Animation.gif"
/>

This is what makes Gatsby page look like they load quickly. The lightweight static HTML version appears first, and then heavier files and interactive elements are layered on afterwards.

React handles any changes and user interactions. Once an element is clicked or changed, React "[rehydrates](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/react-hydration/)" the page.

## The Abridged Essay Version

I've been immersed in the world of React developers since 2016. As a cultural anthropologist, the beliefs, norms, and social dynamics of Reactland have always been more intriguing to me than the useEffect hook or concurrent mode.

### What is cultural anthropology?

If you have never head of "**cultural anthropology**," don't worry. That's expected. It doesn’t often overlap with the world of web development and as a discipline it's not great at self-promotion.

It's essentially the study of human cultures and trying to understand how they work.

Or as one of my favourite anthropologists [Tim Ingold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Ingold) puts it:

<BasicImage
    width="880px"
    alt="Cultural anthropology is philosophy with the people in it"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1597334937/maggieappleton.com/notes/anthropology-react-slides/ReactRally2020-Draft1.012.png"
/>

<Subtext>

From [Anthropology: Why it Matters](/anthropology-matters)

</Subtext>

Anthropology tries to answer many of the same questions philosophers concern themselves with;

_Why do we have language?
How should we organise our societies and institutions?
How do we deal with birth, death, morality, and conflict?_

Philosophers turn inwards to find these answers. They go into a small quiet room alone, think a lot, and read books by mostly old dead white men to find answers.

In contrast, Anthropology turns outwards - **it looks for the answers in people.** By living among them, learning from them, and taking part in their lives. A process known as [Participant Observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participant_observation).

It isn't searching for one universal truth of all humanity, but rather **particular truths for particular people**, at particular points in time.

---

### Why care about the anthropology of React?

Looking at React through a cultural lens helps us understand it as more than simply **"a JavaScript library for building user interfaces"**.

Technical definitions can be reductive - they draw a technological box around our concepts that hide the historical and cultural context.

<BasicImage
    width="880px"
    alt="The react logo inside a strict technical box"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1597334929/maggieappleton.com/notes/anthropology-react-slides/ReactRally2020-Draft1.008.png"
/>

What happens if we expand our understanding to include all the people who surround this React, and how they might **affect** and **be affected by** what's inside it?

<BasicImage
    width="880px"
    alt="An expanded circle of all the people of react"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1597334932/maggieappleton.com/notes/anthropology-react-slides/ReactRally2020-Draft1.010.png"
/>

What if we entertain the idea that humans and the culture of React are an essential part of what defines React? What if we consider it a cultural ecosystem we're _active participants_ in, rather than simply a package we `npm install`

Cultural anthropology is perfectly placed to help us find answers to these questions.

---

### Understanding the "The React Community"

We should establish who we’re talking about when we say “the react community” - where do we think the boundaries of the React community are, and who do we think is part of it?

<BasicImage
    width="880px"
    alt="How do we define the React community?"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1597334943/maggieappleton.com/notes/anthropology-react-slides/ReactRally2020-Draft1.014.png"
/>

I drew a very incomplete and fuzzy map of the React world here. It’s definitely not comprehensive or to scale.

<img
    alt="A hand drawn map of the react community"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1597334948/maggieappleton.com/notes/anthropology-react-slides/ReactRally2020-Draft1.015.png"
/>

I drew this to point out two key things.
First, being a React person isn’t a mutually exclusive identity - you can be other things too.

We have many overlapping and neighbouring communities we all belong to. You might also be part of the Data Viz world, or hang out within a sub niche like React Native.

Second, our community has very fluid boundaries. People flow in and out quite easily – anyone who finds it can join. To become a member you didn’t need to fill out a form and send it to a committee, or go through an initiation ceremony.

You also have the freedom to leave whenever you like.

These fuzzy boundaries sometimes make us a little bit anxious - it's hard to know who's part of the group, and weakens our sense of being a cohesive whole.

Another way to try and understand the React community is to look at some rough numbers.

<BasicImage
    width="880px"
    alt="Stats on how many React developers participate in Github, Reddit, and Dsicord groups"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1200/v1597334954/maggieappleton.com/notes/anthropology-react-slides/ReactRally2020-Draft1.016.png"
/>

These are interesting indicators, but they're not necessarily helpful if we're primarily interested in how React works as a cultural system.

---

### React is an Imagined Community

Rather than talking about stats and numbers, it’s much more meaningful for us to talk about React an an [imagined community](/imagined-communities)

This was a concept developed by a political scientist called [Benedict Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Anderson) in the 1980’s.

Anderson was writing about how nations imagine themselves as collective wholes, but his theory maps very well to how online communities like React work.

An imagined community has nothing to do with it being imaginary in the sense of being fake, but simply that it’s something we have to mentally construct across thousands of individual minds. It gets built through shared images and rituals.

Anderson specifically uses the idea of a national daily newspaper.

The act of sitting down and reading the daily news, and imagining a whole nation of other people, similar like you, sitting and reading those exact same words at roughly the same time, creates a sense of collective belonging.

It’s a daily ritual that reaffirms your membership, and sense of unity with a greater whole.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[
A gift economy is a _system of exchange_ based on gift giving.

Valuables are given without explicit agreement of future rewards between individuals, or within a contained community of people.

<BasicImage
    width="880px"
    alt="Gift economies are systems of exchange based on gift-giving"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best,w_1200/v1589328834/maggieappleton.com/notes/gift-economy.jpg"
/>

Gift economies have a few key qualities. They are...

1. **Loosely and informally tracked** - it is bad form to calculate the exact value of gifts you receive, or keep an obsessive log of it the way we do with business finances
2. **Indirect** - it is not always two individuals giving back and forth. Instead gifting is generalised to a whole community where you may give to people who have not given directly to you
3. **Delayed** - we do not reciprocate gifts the minute we receive them, but instead wait to repay the offering at a later date

The emphasis in a gift exchange is on **strengthening the bond between the givers and receivers.**

It creates a kind of "positive debt," where two people or groups are now tied to one another - one party will always owe the other something. It's a purposeful way of entwining lives and communities together.

---

## Why do we feel compelled to reciprocate gifts?

The grand mystery of gifting and gift economies is why we feel _obliged_ to reciprocate. When someone gives you something, it sparks a strong desire to return in kind.

We don't have a pat answer to where this compulsion comes from, but we can certainly argue generosity and social connection are useful evolutionary traits if we want to get biologically reductive about it.

[Marcel Mauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Mauss) is perhaps the most infamous Anthropologist to explore this question in his book [The Gift](https://www.librarything.com/work/69346) <Footnote idName={1}>Not to be mistaken with [Lewis Hyde's book](https://www.librarything.com/work/258760) of the same name, although it's more focused on art and creation as a gift. Not a bad read, but a bit of a title hijack.</Footnote>

    title="The Gift"
    author="Marcell Mauss"
    description="An anthropological classic on gift theory and gift economies. Published in 1923, Marcel Mauss explores how systems of exchange work in traditional societies around the world in relation to politics, power, and kinship."
/>

Mauss concluded that the objects we are given _"are seen to partake of something of the personality of the giver"_. 154

Mauss described it through the idea of the Maori idea of **hau** - the "spirit of the gift" where the giver's 'soul', or some kind of personal quality, is entangled with the gift object that wishes to return home to its owner. Thus compelling the receiver to make a return.

This interpretation of Maori **hau** ended up being strongly criticised as a misunderstanding and vast oversimplification of the true cultural meaning.

But the deeper idea Mauss was trying to get at is still worth highlighting. Just without a culturally appropriated term.

## Reciprocating Appropriately

When we return a gift, our offering has to be of **similar or slightly higher value** than the original. But not by too much.

If you bring me a ginger biscuit with my cup of tea, and two days later I reciprocate with a gourmet, two-tiered red velvet cake with your name in icing, we would all consider that an awkward, creepy, and overall a socially inappropriate response.

Just giving you a ginger biscuit back works well enough. Returning a gift of the exact same value resolves the debt, but also breaks the cycle.

Everyone is now even, and there’s no more need to continue biscuit-gifting. We can safely return to the pre-biscuit-gifting-days, but doing so also weakens our social connection.

If I have a particular political or personal interest in strengthening our social relationship, I need to give you a treat of slightly higher value – perhaps a chocolate hobnob or home-made scone.

Which both demonstrates I'm invested in this relationship, and also leaves you slightly indebted to me, thus compelling the gift cycle onwards.

## Gift Economies and Market Economies

We often contrast the Gift Economy with the Market Economy. This is a wild oversimplification, but humans like to think in Cultural Dichotomies.

Market Economies are _systems of exchange based on buying and selling things with money_. A market exchange is **specific, quantifiable, direct, immediate, founded upon an explicit agreement**. As in, this croissant costs £1 right now.

Buying an irrationally overpriced granola bar from an airport vending machine is an example of a pure market exchange without a social layer. It’s me, a machine, and a £3 bar of sugar to help me survive this long layover.

I want food, and whoever owns this machine wants money. This is not the time or the place for a gift economy. It would be terribly inconvenient for me to rely on an unpredictable system of granola bar gifts from the strangers around me while starving in an unfamiliar airport.

There are humans who own this vending machine, who will eventually get that money. But they are very far away in time and space – both geographically and socially.

If challenged, I would have a terrible time tracking them down and having a chat. I have only the weakest sense of a human relationship with them, and there is hardly a social bond being woven – this granola bar is about an immediate and specific exchange of needs.

Here, the market economy works wonders. Life necessities like food, shelter, and water are not good candidates for a gifting system. Which is why we tend to gift luxury items, novelties, and socks.

This is also why it's problematic when food, shelter, and water are framed as "gifts" which is sometimes how charitable donations work – as _optional_ acts of generosity.

We all know the "head the family" is not just referring to a floating human head, but instead the entire person who holds the power in a family unit.

It's a shorthand way of giving us something small, specific, and often visible to refer to, especially when the whole concept is a more abstract.

## Using part of something to refer to the larger whole is called **Synecdoche**

We refer to a collection of businessmen as **suits**.  
For politicians who run a national government we use the physical places they meet like **Parliament**, or **Number 10**, or **the White House**.  
To tell someone we like their car we say that's a nice **set of wheels**.  
We might ask for **a hand** carrying in the groceries, when we really need a whole human to come help out.

We pick physical symbols like bits of clothing, buildings, limbs, or locations to give us a tangible reference point for a less tangible group of people or an idea.

Synecdoche is especially important in creating Visual Explanations and Visual Metaphors, as it allows us to reference non-physical concepts in visible, physical symbols we can draw.

It's an offshoot of **Metonymy** - when we refer to one concept using a different but related symbol.

[Jared Pereira](https://awarm.space/) has been running a wonderful series of personal [website tours](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEXbN99LY3OCarUeXcxWeZzOelXQvVdAA) this year.

The guest list features many of my favourite [[Digital Gardeners]] and [indie web](https://indieweb.org/) creators such as [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/), [Chris Aldrich](https://boffosocko.com/), and [Azlen Elza](https://azlen.me/).

I recently stopped in to show what this website looks like behind the Wizard of Oz curtain:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUGoPcQleto

### Tech Stack and Features

-   All posts (notes, essays, books) written with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) - allows me to write React components inside markdown files for extra JavaScript power ✨
-   I use the CSS-in-JS library [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for styling components
-   Responsive footnotes implemented with [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) (no JavaScript required!)
-   [[Bi-directional Links]] with [gatsby-theme-brain](https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/gatsby-theme-brain), and page previews adapted from [gatsby-theme-andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy)
-   [Tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/) for tooltip popovers
-   Images hosted on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to avoid the long build times when using [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/)
-   Deploys to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) directly from Github. Currently takes 4 minutes for the site to build and deploy. I have no idea if that's good or not, but I'll take it 🤷🏻‍♀️

<IntroParagraph>

In September of 2019 I went through the [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) course<Footnote idName={1}>And took illustrated notes that you can take a look at [here](/basb)</Footnote> – an enormously popular online guide to improving your "_Personal Knowledge Management_" system.<Footnote idName={2}>Or PKM as it's commonly known, is a novel name for an old concept. The art of filtering, curating, and cultivating what you read and encounter. And then being able to turn it into "useful output" of some variety. </Footnote> The course did wonders for my information streams and note taking organisation, but the core ethos left me with questions.

</IntroParagraph>

> What does it mean to build a "second brain," and why do we think that's a **Good** and **Valuable** thing to do?

What strange historical and cultural paths led us to this cerebral cyborgian dream?

Many of these questions and themes align with concepts I explored in [[Tracking Humanity]] - my anthropology thesis on the Quantified Self movement.

Luckily I have a small community of fellow BASB-enthusiasts here in London to explore these questions with.  
At our March 2020 meetup I put together a lightening talk exploring how Second Braining relates to our notions of cyborgs, our embodied experiences, and the historical legacies that landed us here.

[Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) proposed the term [Evergreen Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) to describe a system of note-taking that aspires towards cumulative personal knowledge, rather than simply information capture.

/>

The idea builds off many other note-taking philosophies like Niklas Luhmann's [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method <Footnote idName={1}>Andy also wrote a good post [Comparing Evergreens vs Zettles](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4AX7pHAu5uUfmrq4K4zig9x8jmmF62XgaMXm)</Footnote>, and Sonke Ahren's [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.librarything.com/work/21425376) system.

My personal notes system has been heavily influenced by the Evergreening ethos. In both my [[Roam Garden]] and on this very [[Digital Gardening]] website. My notes taxonomy flows from "Seedlings" to "Budding" to "Evergreens"

To help myself internalise some of the main Evergreen principles, I illustrated them out below. <Footnote idName={2}>These aren't a comprehensive explanation, so I recommend reading the [original source material](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) if this piques your interest.</Footnote>

I've been looking into both [[Pattern Languages]] and [[Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning]] over the past month.

[The Knowledge Hydrant](http://www.industriallogic.com/papers/khdraft.pdf) is where these two meet in a lovely swirl of collaborative learning and organically emergent systems.

It's a draft document written up by [Joshua Kerievsky](https://twitter.com/JoshuaKerievsky) in 1999. The mini-manifesto describes a set of **Design Patterns** that people can use to set up their own indie study groups outside of formal structures like universities.

While the original focused on IRL, "co-present" <Footnote idName={1}>Getting real good at the [[Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning]] buzzwords and jargon over here</Footnote> groups, I'm fascinated by how we might adapt these patterns and turn them into internet-friendly, distributed digital versions.

Here's notes on the original while I'm thinking it through...

### What tools do you use to illustrate?

Primarily my brain and upper body limbs. With a little help from [Procreate](https://procreate.art/) on an iPad Pro. I do a little color and brightness editing in Photoshop as well, but it's a pretty minor step.

I'm betting want more information than that, so I wrote a whole post called [[What App is That?]] for you.

<br />

### Do you have any resources or advice for someone who wants to get started with making illustrations?

Lots!
Have a look at the [Resources](/resources) page for a collection of courses, learning platforms, and books I personally recommend.

You might also want to read my essay series on [[Drawing Invisible Programming Concepts]]

<br />

### I want prints of your illustrations. Can I buy prints from you or print them myself?

You can indeed print any images you find here for your own personal use!

The image quality on the garden notes and twitter is low for printing (72dpi). But if you join my email list I send out high-quality, downloadable versions on there (300dpi – big enough to print on the side of a wall if you so desire).

I'm not fan of the carbon emissions involved in printing, storing, and shipping these from a central location. So if you want professional prints I suggest finding a local printer near you and sending them the high-res files.

<br />

### Do you consider yourself a designer or developer?

Both. I find the distinction between the two fields necessary on the macro scale of our whole industry, but fairly irrelevant on the micro scale of an individual making things in the world.

I starting learning HTML at 12 because I wanted to figure out how to layout a bunch of Neopets images in a table format. Development skills have always been a necessary tool in my design process.

### How would you describe your work?

I think about this too much, but I would shelve everything I do under the banner of **visual explanations**. This conveniently vague term includes everything from **illustrated notes and essays** to **interface design**.

What I don't make:

-   **Comics** - Comics tell a narrative story over time. I mostly explain non-narrative topics and explore ideas atemporarily out of time. They share a lot of comic-like qualities though, and I've spent countless hours studying & stealing techniques from comic artists like [Will Eisner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Eisner), [Nick Sousanis](http://spinweaveandcut.com/), and [Scott McCloud](http://scottmccloud.com/).
-   **Infographics** - Infographics have [a particular aesthetic](https://www.pinterest.com/visualistan/latest-infographics/) that makes my eyes bleed. While technically these do communicate information through graphics, the word _infographic_ comes with visual baggage. And I would like to run very, very far away from it.
-   **Sketchnotes** - If we define 'sketchnotes' as true _sketches_ – unrefined, unplanned visual scribbles – my work doesn't fit.
    They're far more crafted and planned than stream-of-consciousness sketches drawn in one fell swoop.

<br />

### Have a question I haven't answered?

[Stian Håklev](http://reganmian.net/blog/), a fellow [[Roam Gardener]] and twitter friend, clued me in to the field of **Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning**.<Footnote idName={1}>Stian is a fascinating thinker, and I'd recommend <a href="https://louis-and-kyle.simplecast.com/episodes/stian-haklev-012">this podcast interview</a> to hear about his PhD in CSCL and applying it at <a href="https://www.minervaproject.com/">The Minerva Project</a></Footnote>

Much like the name suggests, it's an academic discipline exploring the possibilities of pedagogy and education where **collaboration** and **computers** are first-class considerations.

Rather than treating digital mediums as a supportive system or extra add-on in a normal classroom environment, they're **The Main Thing**. And rather than focusing on how _individuals_ learn and understand, knowledge building as a _group_ is prioritised.

It's a reaction against what's known as the _"direct transmission"_ model – the view that learning is an individual experience of **passively receiving content** from someone lecturing at you.

TLDR; it's an entire academic discipline studying how we can build digitally-mediated [Communities of Practice](http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Community_of_practice) for learning <Footnote idName={2}>Or, in their own words... "CSCL is a field of study centrally concerned with meaning and the practices of meaning-making in the context of joint activity, and the ways in which these practices are mediated through designed artifacts." <br/> <a href="http://www.gerrystahl.net/hci/cscl2002intro.pdf">Stahl, G. (2002) Computer Support <br/>For Collaborative Learning</a></Footnote>.

Stian warned me that, like almost all academic disciplines, they haven't mastered the art of [Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/). Some cursory research made it clear the main medium of communication for these folks is obscure academic conference papers and £200 scholarly publications.

The buzzwords and acronyms are stacked high.

This page is a record of my research as I wander into the world of CSCL – wide-eyed, naive, and excitable.

<h2 style={{ marginBottom: "1em" }}>Key Concepts and Essential Questions</h2>

#### Collaborative Learning Not Guaranteed

CSCL does not claim collaboration is a silver bullet solution to effective learning. Quite the opposite.

All the papers makes clear that collaboration in and of itself doesn't magically produce understanding. **Instead, it needs to be designed, structured, and carefully facilitated to lead to learning.**

The most effective techniques are not surprising...

-   Meaningful discussion, debate, and negotiation that forces us to question our assumptions and revise our conclusions.
-   Explaining your thinking to another human, out loud or in writing, quickly shows how well you know the material.
-   Solving a problem, then comparing your solution to someone elses, and mutually agreeing upon the strengths and weaknesses of each.

Most of the research focuses on designing these intentional collaborative experiences. As well as the systems that make them possible (aka. apps, tools, platforms, all that jazz).

These are not new pedagogical findings, but CSCL is exploring how digital mediums are particularly well-suited to enabling them. Not just within small groups, but at scale.

Computer magic means we can have multiple, intertwining discussions all going on simultaneously. With a far wider range of expertise, experiences, and perspectives. Hence, Twitter.

<ResearchItem title="Computer Support For Collaborative Learning: Foundations for a CSCL Community" link="http://www.gerrystahl.net/hci/cscl2002intro.pdf" author="Stahl (2002)">

"Collaborative Learning does not just mean that individual learning is enhanced by participation in small groups; <mark>it means that it is the groups themselves that learn."</mark> Knowledge is a product of the collaboration process: it <b>arises through interaction of different perspectives</b>, heats up in the cauldron of public discourse, is gradually refined through negotiation, and is <b>codified and preserved in cultural or scientific artifacts</b>"

</ResearchItem>

<ResearchItem title="Designing Integrative Scripts" link="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227175285_Designing_Integrative_Scripts" author="Dillenbourg and Jermann (2007)">

"Collaboration leads to positive outcomes only when students engage in **knowledge generative interactions** such as **giving explanations**, and engaging in **argumentation, negotiation, conflict resolution or mutual regulation**""

given: such <mark>interactions do not necessarily emerge spontaneously"</mark> (Cohen 1994; Salomon and Globerson 1989)

</ResearchItem>

#### Creating Structure with Macro-scripts

It quickly became clear that **macro-scripts** are the bread and butter of CSCL systems. These are the [[Pattern Languages]] of the field that create structured collaboration.

CSCL Macro-scripts describe how a learning experience will play out.
On a general level, they define **a sequence of activities** focused around **a learning goal.** The learners all have assigned **roles** and follow a set of **constraints and rules for interaction.**

It sets up the whole dinner party for you, so participants can just show up and know all the learning logistics are taken care of.

That might sound a bit prescriptive. Until you realise every social interaction you engage in works this way. But most of the time our scripts and roles are so internalised they become invisible.

When we walk into a grocery store we play the role of shopper and follow the put-stuff-in-basket script. It would be disastrously off-script to begin eating a fresh croissant while standing in the bakery aisle, or to walk behind a checkout counter and begin scanning our own groceries. We have all been <Tooltip tiptext={<span>"The process by which people learn the dynamics of their surrounding culture and acquire values and norms appropriate or necessary in that culture and worldviews" - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enculturation">Enculturation on Wikipedia</a></span>}><i>enculturated</i></Tooltip> to follow the script. <Footnote idName={3}>What I'm describing is a well-established social theory developed by many people, but my favourite is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erving_Goffman">Erving Goffman</a>'s account that he presented in the classic book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_analysis">Frame Analysis</a>. Goffman refers to the social setting that scripts play out in as a "Frame"</Footnote>

Scripts make it much more likely learners will **develop a thorough understanding of the material**, and come away with **original perspectives on it.**

There's also a need for a fine balance of structure and improvisation. If scripts are too weak the learning experience falls apart. If they're too rigid or irrelevant, interactions become boring, sterile, and rote.

<br />

(2007)">

"CSCL scripts are primarily considered as support devices enabling learners to **stick to an effective pattern of collaboration more easily** and to obtain improved learning outcomes" (156)

</ResearchItem>

<ResearchItem title="Over-scripting CSCL: The risks of blending collaborative learning with instructional design" link="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1556/e5d2f93f6400457b422a011d7d93a3aa29fe.pdf" author="Dillenbourg (2002)">

"Free collaboration does not systematically produce learning. One way to enhance the effectiveness of collaborative learning is to **structure interactions by engaging students in well-defined scripts**. A collaboration script is a set of instructions prescribing how students should form groups, how they should interact and collaborate and how they should solve the problem"

</ResearchItem>

#### Playing the Role

One of the most intruiging elements of macro-scripts is that they define **clear roles** for each participant.

Most of us have been in meetings with assigned _facilitators_ and _scribes_, but we rarely expand beyond these.

Why stop there? What if we add in...

-   A _Research-Runner_ who is in charge of fetching up links and references mentioned in the discussion.
-   A _Sceptic_ or _Devil's Advocate_ who (constructively) raises objections and counter-opinions
-   A _Timekeeper_ who moves us through the learning plan on schedule
-   A _Summariser_ who captures the group's conclusions in succinct statements
-   A _Reflector_ who mirrors people's points back to them in their own words
-   An _Explorer_ responsible for gathering wildly off-beat references outside the traditional domain

There's a huge range of role options that you can pick and choose from depending on the size, synchronicity, and goals of the group.

The [Group Work Roles](http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Group_work_roles) page on EduTech Wiki (an overall great place) elaborates on this list.

---

#### What's a "Community of Practice"?

Coined by [Etienne Wegner](https://wenger-trayner.com/), a community of practice is a group of people "who **share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a topic**, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise by interacting on an ongoing basis."<Footnote idName={4}><a href="https://wenger-trayner.com/introduction-to-communities-of-practice/">Introduction to <br />communities of practice</a> - Etienne and Beverly Wenger-Trayner (2015)</Footnote>

It's a collection of people who are into the same stuff as you, that you end up stumbling into organically. In an ad-hoc decentralised way, you start collectively problem-solving and learning with them in a weird, emergent, beautiful process.

No one plans the community. No one regulates or controls it. There is no central calendar of events.

You earn membership by proving you have the right domain expertise and [Cultural Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_capital) to belong there. This doesn't necessarily mean an official domain like Biochemical Engineering. Knitting clubs and Favela gangs have equally valid kinds of domain expertise.

CSCL mentions Communities of Practice a lot. While much of the research focuses on your typical K-12 formal school institutions, there's a decent branch of it trying to figure out how we can foster and facilitate better CoP's.

<IntroParagraph>

**Understanding by Design** (or UbD) is one of our core pillars at [egghead](https://egghead.io/). It's an approach to designing learning experiences that begin with the end in mind.

</IntroParagraph>

You start with the goals of what you want someone else to learn, and **backwards plan** from that point.

This seems obvious when you say it, but when most of us go to teach something, we look at the big pile of material we _could_ teach – all the tips and principles and techniques we have at hand – and organise them into little related clusters and try to stumble towards some vague end learning goal.

This is forwards planning. It seems logical. Except if we don't pick our destination ahead of time, it's just wandering around without a path. Hoping we end up somewhere nice by chance.

What if we reverse it?

<IntroParagraph>

There's an established concept called **Silent Meetings**. Much like it sounds, it's a meeting where for the most part no one talks.

</IntroParagraph>

Rather than one PowerPoint dictator lecturing to a room full of checked out people, silent meetings shift discussion into online collaborative documents.

Everyone sits quietly on their own device and comments on a **"Table Read"** – a shared document in Google Docs or Figma or a webpage annotated with <a href="https://hypothes.is">Hypothes.is</a>

People add comments and discussion points to the document directly. They're able to easily refer to specific parts, respond to other people's comments, and **run multiple threaded discussions**. Instead of one leader or instructor talking **at** many people, it's many people all talking **to** each other.

David Gasca wrote up a <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-silent-meeting-manifesto-v1-189e9e3487eb">comprehensive manifesto</a> on the phenomenon in 2019 that dives into the implementation details for using them at companies.

While it's a great concept for Corporateland, I'm keen to explore how we could use it for collaborative learning communities online.

Many of my [[Cozy Web]] communities are full of voracious readers. We're often looking for ways to run ad-hoc book clubs and reading groups, but the established formats are fairly vanilla. Standard Zoom calls. Or async stream discussions in Slack-esque apps.

The tools are janky. The [[Pattern Languages]] aren't well established. Systems like [[the Knowledge Hydrant]] give us good starting points, but aren't design with an online environment in mind.

One challenge of distributed learning is the coordination around timing. **Async reading doesn't focus collective attention in one place at one time.**

Picking a single time to 'meet' in a document gives people a structured frame to fully focus on reading, thinking, and discussing

The opportunity to follow up with a video or voice call right after also creates space for social bonding, nuanced conversations, and collaborative meaning-making. It prevents Twitter-esque brutality and presumptive misunderstandings.

I'm beginning to try this out. TBD

Suspense is [an upcoming React feature](https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-suspense.html) that's part of the new "concurrent mode."

Since everyone is getting all hyped up about it, I wanted to figure out what the excitement was and drew some quick summary notes.

I've made plenty of illustrated notes for <a href="https://egghead.io/">egghead</a> courses.  
On everything from [[Building Custom React Hooks]] to [[Fixing Common Git Mistakes]] to [[The Basics of Rust]]

They've always been artefacts made in post-production.  
I draw them after the course has already been planned, and the videos are all recorded.

Over the last month I've been experimenting with a more collaborative approach.

Rather than treating our illustrations as a shiny add-on made by one person, I wanted to directly involve our course instructors and figure out how to **directly pair their expertise with my visual thinking skills**.

So I started running visual workshopping sessions.

We hop on a Zoom call and open up a shared canvas in <a href="https://miro.com/">Miro</a> or <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw</a>. <Footnote idName={1}>They're both great and do the trick for the task at hand. I recommend playing with both!</Footnote>
We pick out a few of the toughest concepts, and begin making extremely rough diagrams. Experimental ugliness is the whole point.

We just did our first trial of this with <a href="https://tlakomy.com">Tomasz Lakomy</a>'s new course on <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/build-an-app-with-the-aws-cloud-development-kit">AWS Cloud Development</a>.

<br />

<Subtext>Here's Tomasz thinking very hard about API Gateways</Subtext>

<h1>The Process</h1>

<p>
    The visuals we made during the workshopping session were mostly made of
    boxes and arrows and labels like this:

    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_660/v1592317154/maggieappleton.com/notes/visual-aws/aws-cdk-post-10.png"
/>

<p>
    It's all you really need to establish the basics. Nouns (things) are boxes,
    and verbs (actions and events) are arrows.
</p>

<p>
    After the workshopping call I looked back over the diagrams, and sketched
    out an illustrated version that adds a bit more clarity and dimension to the
    scene:

/>

<p>
    I ran the sketch by Tomasz to make sure all the technical details were
    correct. Then did a final linework pass over the top to neaten everything
    up:

    {" "}
    We ended up with five of these illustrations that cover all the main concepts
    of the course{" "}

If you're just here for all the gritty details of AWS you might want to check out the course itself. If you're here for the visual process, I popped a few more thoughts below..

<h2>Collaborative Minds > Beginners Mind</h2>

<p>
    I may know a few things about how to visually explain ideas, but I usually
    know _next to nothing_ about the topic of any given course.
</p>

There are some advantages to this.
Beginners mind is a beautiful thing.

But it has it's limitations. Because in order to visually explain something _well_, you need to truly understand it.

When we draw there are no vague relationships or fuzzy edges.  
You have to make clear how all the parts of a system are related.  
What's above and below. What's a container and what's a substance.  
What actions and events are happening between elements.

<p>It requires a nuanced understanding of the material.</p>

<p>
    My old beginners notes are still useful - they make the implicit explicit.
    They explain concepts the expert would never think to.
</p>

But they also fall short in lots of ways. I make mistakes. I skim the surface of material. I can't dive deep on technical details.

Collaborative workshopping gives us the best of both worlds. I still get to ask dumb questions (purposefully), like **"is the React app above or below the GraphQL request?"** or **"does an S3 bucket have a lid?"**

It's the Socratic method for visual thinking.

Asking these odd questions helps us establish a vocabulary of shapes, sizes, colors, metaphors, and spatial relationships.

Our instructors have the deep context to answer these kind of questions well, and reason through why certain visual arrangements make more sense than others.

I'm just there to prod them in certain directions, and add a bit of polish afterwards.

We're doing plenty more of these. I can't wait <span>🤓</span>

## A **Pattern Language** is a set of flexible, reusable solutions to common design problems.

These patterns evolve naturally within systems, and are found rather than crafted. Identifying and recognising these patterns gives us a framework to craft solutions with.

There is no one way to implement a design pattern – they are purposefully abstract enough that you can apply them to the situation at hand. They're guiding principles instead of formulaic instructions.

Christopher Alexander developed the idea of Pattern Languages in their 1977 book.

<ResourceBook
    style={{ marginTop: "0.4em" }}
    large
    url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language"
    img="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DirDeK3tL.jpg"
    title="A Pattern Language"
    author="Christopher Alexander"
    description="The book outlined a number of solutions for architecture and urban planning design, but the theory has since (appropriately) taken on a life of its own."
/>

The programming community picked up on on Christopher Alexander's ideas in the late 1980's.

Despite the original book being primarily about public transportation tempos and cafe sidewalk strategies, the notion of design patterns heavily influenced the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object-Oriented Programming</a> languages like Smalltalk and C++.

In a charming presentation at the 1996 OOPSLA conference (Object-Oriented Programs, Systems, Languages and Applications, obviously), Alexander openly admits **"I'm address a room full of people and I don't know hardly anything about what all of you do"**.

In September of 2019 I took a course called <a href='https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com'>Building a Second Brain</a> by <a href='https://twitter.com/fortelabs'>Tiago Forte</a>.

Much like it sounds, Building a Second Brain is about creating a reliable system – outside your physical skin-and-bone bodily boundaries – for storing, organising, digesting, and eventually transforming information into Good Creative Output.

Much like any well-integrated tool, the mental distance between you and the system grows small.  
It's a lovely little closed feedback loop – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">a cybernetic system</a>.  
At this point almost all of my daily workflow revolves around my second brain. as, articles, books, papers, podcasts, and half-formed thoughts go in.  
These build into notes and develop over time – they merge, meander, and mature into talks and blog posts and illustrations.  
It is hard to remember what my workflow looked like without it.

For tools I'm currently using <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, backed up by <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/">Keyboard Maestro</a> for some fancy automation elements.

These illustrated cover all the sections of the course. Enjoy!

To be clear there's no affiliate as or kickback involved in these notes.
I'm not being paid to say nice things about the course.

Tiago's ideas and systems are just good.  
He thinks everything through in a way that feels rare on the insta-internet.

Hope it gave you a bit of insight into the BASB system.
There's plenty more to explore on Tiago's <a href="https://praxis.fortelabs.co/">Forte Labs Blog</a> and he's <a href="https://twitter.com/fortelabs">good at tweeting</a>.

My obsession with metaphor isn't original, it's genetically inherited.
My mother <a href='http://www.thelibrarianedge.com/'>Katie Day</a> planted all the original seeds.

The paperback copies of [Metaphors We Live By](./mwlb) and [Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things](./womenfiredangerous) are visceral childhood memories as much as they're current intellectual kindling.

As a teacher and librarian, her research focuses on using metaphors in pedagogy, digital literacy, and information science. But our worlds overlap in the more fundamental obsession with how we can use metaphors to communicate ideas to others.

We started collecting <a href="https://www.librarything.com/list/20481/all/Metaphors-etc">a metaphorical reading list</a> a few years back that I just rediscovered.

If you're exploring conceptual metaphor and want to start digging deeper, have a look at these

[OpenSpaceWorld](https://openspaceworld.org/wp2/)

-   "**Open Space (Technology)** is a simple way to run productive meetings, for five to 2000+ people, and a powerful approach to leadership in any kind of organization, in everyday practice and turbulent change."
-   "Open Space can also refer to **any approach that “opens space” for something possible to happen, for some potential to be realised. It suggests that a situation may be restricted by too much control and structure, limiting the potential to “open up” that situation to its latent potential**"
-   Open Space runs on two fundamentals: **passion** and **responsibility**. Passion engages the people in the room. Responsibility ensures things get done
-   a natural communication process that recognizes that people take responsibility to pursue what they are passionate about, and it ensures that what is important to each participant will be discussed.

## Tracking Humanity: The Quantified Self Movement

</SmallCenter>

<IntroParagraph>

The introduction and first chapter of my mediocre undergraduate thesis about the Quantified Self movement, cyborg anthropology, technological embodiment, and Western Cosmology.

</IntroParagraph>

Written between 2012/2013 for a BA in Cultural Anthropology.

Some of my opinions, and many elements of the self-tracking community have changed since this was written. Yet I'm still thinking along many of the same threads, and exploring parallel ideas.

It's relevant to the rest of my work, but should be taken with a large grain of salt 🙃

<br />

## Introduction

The Quantified Self movement is concerned with exactly what you might expect – quantifying the self.

Aligning their identity with units of measurement and numerical data, **they seek a self-knowledge that will lead to the improvement of both the individual, and implicitly, the greater society** – the supposed ultimate goal of progressing humanity forward.

The ideology of the Quantified Self movement is important to us because it is not only theirs, in many ways it is our own.

Based in ideas native to the Western world that have now reigned for centuries, **their curious conceptions about the body and self are ones we share**.

Understanding the historical emergence, beliefs, concerns, and interests of this community will teach us about ourselves as much as it does about them.

---

Beginning with an exploration of the historical foundations of the West, my theory builds off the work of Marshall Sahlins in bringing attention to how **we have a very particularly constructed idea of the “self,” as a need-driven and imperfect being** living within a dualistically divided body and mind.

Seeking to fix our supposed imperfections, we cultivated the dominance of science and medicine over our natural bodies by beginning to **understand our physical form within the metaphor of machinery**.

While the Quantified Self movement in many ways ascribes to these beliefs, and is clearly built upon these foundations of imbuing objective, empirical and quantifiable data with legitimacy, they also challenge and seek to revolutionise the modern institutions of science and biomedicine.

Primarily concerned with the generalised knowledge that the two impose upon individual bodies, the Quantified Self ideology believes each singular person should be able to determine their own personal truths and treatments, leading them to establish and advocate for the joint concepts of _personal science_ and _personalised medicine_.

---

I discuss how the technological devices pervasively used within the Quantified Self community are leading them to new experiences of embodiment.

This **technological embodiment redefines the boundaries of the self.**

It engages us in debates over animated agency, emotional intimacy, and holistically interdependent and interconnected systems. It challenges many of our default anthropocentric attitudes towards the world.

These emerging relationships with technology are indicative of those going on within our greater society. Quantified Selfers should be considered the frontier of those fully embracing these new embodiments.

They construct new identities and ways of being through technology, especially through the medium of data.

Massive **troves of immaterial online information become representations of selves in the public sphere**, as well as potential channels for manipulation and domination on a socio-political level.

Though many have read the data-collection practices of the Quantified Self community as solely self-surveillance, we find they are actually **choosing to generate and control their own information** rather than wait for greater social and political forces to do it for them.

We are now all implicated in acts of self-quantification and the rise of data-selves by nature of being digitally connected.

A state which raises a plethora of political and personal complications for us to navigate.

If we are already intertwined in a system of data surveillance, **self-trackers may be the ones turning the system into a source of identity, positive meaning and empowerment.**

---

Though they are politically resistant in the field of data surveillance, their underlying ideologies still inherently tie them to fulfilling the needs of a capitalist economy.

> They strive to be optimal citizens: organised, productive, timely, fit, and responsible, giving off the social perception of a well-ordered and lived life.

This pursuit is driven by **a conviction in the natural goodness of capitalism** that resembles religious belief, yet one that fails to result in the transcendent state implicitly promised.

The existence of the Quantified Self movement, a collection of individuals seeking to improve and upgrade themselves in order to manage the unreasonably demanding requirements of the capitalist economy using the same ideological base that brought it into being, should lead us to critically question what they mean by seeking “improvement” in the interests of “progress.”

**We should ask what we they progressing towards and whether it truly serves their own interests.**

---

Throughout this critical exploration, and despite the occasional bold conclusion, I do not mean to “other” the Quantified Selfers.

When taken in cultural context, **their practices and beliefs are reasonable and rational**. The ways we enact these same beliefs are simply more familiar to us – we have been performing them for so long they do not seem alien or absurd to our eyes.

Amassing, meticulously graphing, and developing formulas based on the data points of a morning routine puts these convictions into such a stark light that we react with shock, and often quickly move to ridicule those who practice it.

**Out of a lack of empathetic understanding (and perhaps some confusion and fear), many have defaulted to portraying Quantified Selfers as a misguided, fringe population** numerically desecrating the sanctity of the human self.

My research explores and challenges both this inaccurate portrayal of the community, as well as the notion that we have a sacred pre-defined “human nature” in need of defending.

The movement is not what many take it as.

> They are often holistically humanistic rather than reductively mechanical, diverse rather than monolithic, evolving and dynamic rather than static, and critically questioning rather than passively complying.

Above all other qualities, I found the Quantified Self movement to be **defined by a diversity and complexity of opinions**.

Members expressed wide varieties of dynamic, evolving ideas and contradictory ideologies. To study, think, and write about the movement as a whole concept and bound community was a challenging and confusing task on numerous occasions.

Despite these rifts and differences, the Quantified Self community indeed shares fundamental and core beliefs about the value of self- improvement through quantified self-knowledge, providing them with enough common ground to engage in building a meaningful social world.

Location: the world of the Quantified Self – the self understood and expressed through numbers, data, and quantified statistics.

Summed up by their tagline “self-knowledge through numbers,” the concept of the “Quantified Self” encompasses a both a cultural ideology and a community of people – who congregate both online and offline – that ascribe to it (Quantified Self 2013).

This distinction between the Quantified Self movement or phenomenon, and the Quantified Self community is an important one.

There is an understanding of a greater “movement” taking place on a social level, believed to be a historical force in itself, with some trackers even calling it “our millennium’s renaissance” (Top Coder Inc 2012).

The movement is driven by specific and historically-located ideas and beliefs guiding this technologically-oriented approach to self-tracking. With it comes an international community whose members self- identify and connect through self-tracking.

---

#### Self-Tracking

What members of this community hold in common is the practice of self-tracking: they collect and store data and information about particular aspects of their life and self.

This practice revolves around designing projects that target specific variables. The kind of things that people choose to track is seemingly infinite – ranging from the common areas of sleep, time, physical exercise, and food intake, to the more creative variable of monitoring of Twitter activity, shower temperatures, snoring, and perceived quality of social conversations (Quantified Self 2013).

It is a running joke within the community that any aspect of life you can imagine being tracked, probably is being tracked a Quantified Selfer somewhere in the world.

Keeping tabs on the self is nothing terribly new: Benjamin Franklin is one historical figure known to have written of his adherence to thirteen key values each day (Dembosky 2011). <Footnote idName={1}>There now exists an iPhone application where you too can track Franklin’s thirteen prescribed virtues over the course of your day.</Footnote>

Self-trackers often like to harken back to such historical individuals, attempting to convey the message that surveying the self in pursuit of improvement has been a noble and worthwhile activity for hundreds of years (Kelly 2012b).

The practice seems to have been an especially prevalent theme in the history of Western culture, appearing everywhere from religious virtues to nationalistic demands of responsible citizenship.

Appreciating the influence of these historically-based ideas on the current Quantified Self movement is central to understanding how and why it has emerged.

In many ways that is part of the real significance of this movement: self-tracking has long been a part of ourselves and our cultures.

It is a practice that all of us can relate to, and engage with in small ways – one that is not only growing rapidly, but also shifting forms.

Advancements in technology have now infinitely expanded the realm of self-tracking – making the practice exponentially easier compared to the old pen-and-paper method. From body monitors to smartphone applications, we are now enabling a new age of the measured self.

<br />

#### History and Founding

The Quantified Self movement does not begin or end with any single individual or set of people.

Instead of being “founded,” its origin story is told as a natural emergence out of the way human interaction with technology is already taking shape.

It would be more accurate to say certain leaders emerged who encouraged and facilitated the rise of the culture, shaping the phenomenon by giving it a name and a central digital space where they could communicate, organise, and establish their identity.

These leaders were Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly who set up Quantifiedself.com – the website acting as the online hub of the movement.

The two were journalists already invested in exploring the social and personal meanings behind technology when they met as co-workers at the forward-thinking magazine Wired in 2007.

One an editor and one a writer, they began to collaborate over their shared interest in a technologically-driven trend both had noticed gaining ground among their social circles in the bay area of California; “people subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking that went far beyond the ordinary” (Wolf 2010b).

They attribute the rise of these habits to four factors:

-   The growing ubiquity of personal mobile devices – allowing people to carry powerful computing capacities around in their pockets
-   Advances in the quality, affordability and miniaturisation of electronic body sensors and tracking tools
-   Social media’s normalisation of perpetually sharing intimate information; and the rise of “the digital cloud”
-   The massive increase in capacity of online data hosting and storage, making its collection seem immaterially infinite. (Wolf 2010a; Kelly 2011)

By 2008, the community had grown enough for Kelly and Wolf to feel they needed to establish a supportive limited liability company: Quantified Self Labs (Quantified Self 2013).

Acting as an organisational support, the structure of the company is simple. There are no full time employees and they have a stated goal of “not making organising QS feel like work” (Butterfield 2012:16).

The community aims to promote an egalitarian and democratic power structure by downplaying officiality and hierarchy.

Community Organisation
The community aspect of the Quantified Self movement is intentional and active; bounded together by voluntary, self-expressed membership, they connect through online hubs that typically include forum posts, twitter conversations, blog entries with streams of discussion comments, and informative resource pages such as wikis. On the central website Quantifiedself.com, they define themselves as a “collaboration of users and tool-makers who share an interest in self-knowledge through self-tracking” (Quantified Self 2013). As of April 2013, there are currently 111 registered meet-up groups consisting of 18,558 members across 31 nations in 89 cities–these mini-communities are represented in New York, San Francisco, London and Tokyo, and also extend to places such as Rio de Janeiro, Bangkok, Beijing and Cape Town (Meetup 2013). However, as a geographical trend, the the vast majority of tracking communities are condensed within the Global North.
Meet-ups are regularly scheduled, organised events where members can share their stories of self-experimentation. Run through the website Meetup.com, each geographical area has local voluntary leaders who facilitate the monthly gatherings. These meetings centre around a series of slide-show presentations, called “show-and-tells,” which are usually filmed and later uploaded to internet blogs and websites (Christensen 2013). Anthropologist Adam Butterfield conducted his master’s thesis specifically on Quantified Self community meet-up groups and succinctly defined their content as “personal stories of self-tracking projects” (Butterfield 2012). While this is a simplified description of how the ideology gets communicated between its members and the general public, in a literal sense its is fairly accurate. The emphasis on storytelling using meaningful data is a key component of the Quantified Self movement. Understanding how and why these stories are told is central to understanding the Quantified Self movement and the cultural forces driving and shaping it. Throughout this thesis I will cite many tracking tales told through blog posts, personal websites, filmed presentations, and second-hand accounts in articles. At meet-up presenters are advised to base their talk around three prime questions; first, explain what you did; second, explain how you did it; and third, explain what you learnt (Wolf 2011). Some meet-up communities further structure the story-telling form by suggesting that speakers limit their talks to five minutes, encouraging simple and clear communication (Christensen 2013). The purpose of these presentations is to offer ideas that others might spark inspiration from: different tools and methods for self-tracking, different variables to track, inventive solutions to common problems like trouble sleeping or stress at work. The movement sees themselves as trying to cultivate a “culture of sharing” (Christensen 2013). The ultimate value they share is seeking self-improvement, and through sharing stories, hope to collaboratively encourage and support one another in that goal. Conferences follow a similar structure but are much larger events, usually drawing members from all over a region (such as Europe or the Pacific Northwest) instead of a single city.

The glue holding this community together is undeniably the website Quantifiedself.com. Much like an ever-expanding family tree, it branches outwards connecting a seemingly infinite number of links to online data logging tools, company pages for commercially produced tracking devices and services, YouTube and Vimeo videos of presentations, reviews of smartphone tracking applications, notable personal blogs of self-trackers, and relevant journalistic and academic articles. It is the central hub of this internet-based society.
Quantifiedself.com features many aspects typical of websites that facilitate open and interactive online societies; social forums, active commenting on blog postings, occasional surveys, prompts for open discussions, frequent guest writers, and interviews with notable community members (Quantified Self 2013). This includes a number of recurring features such as: “What We’re Reading” – a compiled list of the latest publications and articles related to the Quantified Self movement, “Toolmaker Talks” – question and answer posts with the developers of popular tracking devices and applications, and “Numbers from Around the Web” – a showcase of especially interesting self-experiments and the resulting data from community members (Quantified Self 2013). This small slice of what type of content is posted should make apparent this website is by no means written or controlled by a single or small handful of individuals.

While Kevin Kelly, Gary Wolf, and Alexandria Carmichael are the official moderators, the
majority of the material is generated from a large and diverse number of contributors. 2

2 Alexandria Carmichael is also the director of Quantified Self Labs, and co-founded the health tracking website CureTogether; a health care company “that brings patients with hundreds of conditions together in overlapping data communities” (CureTogether 2013).

Being an online social group, the nature of the Quantified Self community is fairly fluid with members interacting over “multisited situations with complex, spatially diverse” geographies (Wilson and Peterson 2002:455). In their review of the Anthropology of Online Communities, Wilson and Peterson point out that they are likely to be bound by “asymmetrical, indirect connections,” as people are able to identify with the idea of being part of the community without necessarily making direct personal connections with others (Wilson and Peterson 2002:455). They may simply feel engagement and membership by reading the thoughts and ideas of other members on websites and blogs. The practices of connection can sometimes be socially passive. This quality makes the Quantified Self community an imagined community, a concept developed by political scientist Benedict Anderson to describe a socially-constructed unit where its members understand themselves to be part of a bound whole even in the absence of face-to- face interactions or social events. Becoming part of a community simply requires they imagine themselves to be so, much like being a member of a nation (Anderson 1991). However, in the case of the Quantified Self community, there are also many socially active and physically interactive ways members are bound together. Though geographically spread out over nations and internet cables, there is still a face-to-face aspect of the Quantified Self community in their regularly organised physical meet-ups and conferences. Quantified Self has been described as “a grass-roots movement brought together by the internet” (Harrell 2011), emphasising its nature as democratic and community-driven. This strengthens their resemblance to traditional, localised communities where members are more likely to make direct and personal connections with one another.


Leadership, Power Structures & Cohesion
Although Kevin Kelly and Gary Wolf are often referred to as the “leaders” of the movement, the community tries to cultivate an open and democratic power structure where no single person or set of people speak for everyone. There are, however, many members who are more outspoken and active in publishing ideological writings on the Quantified Self, sometimes referred to as “thought leaders” (Erwin 2012). These are individuals who usually run high-traffic blogs about their Quantified Self lifestyles, regularly publishing advice, reflections, and generally contributing content to the online community and the discussions happening within it. Quantified Selfers may not exactly align their tracking beliefs and habits with members who might be considered “popular” (who themselves hold a diverse range of beliefs around self- tracking), yet these individuals may have greater power and sway within the community thanks to their ability to influence the opinions of their readers. These informal leaders are frequently featured in interviews, articles, and publications about the movement. They appear to be prominent and well-respected figures within the community, with smaller self-tracking blogs frequently referring to and citing them in posts. However, they should not themselves be taken as absolute representations of the movement, nor should they be assumed to speak on behalf of the entire community (Erwin 2012). In his ethnographic work, Butterfield found it is certainly “not a monolithic community where everyone involved shares the same ideas about, and interests in, self-tracking” (Butterfield 212:49). Though Kelly and Wolf may have run the first Quantified Self meet-up, both believe the movement has “taken on a life of its own, and in some ways, taken on a different meaning” (Butterfield 2012:16). The Quantified Self ideology itself has evolved in its short six year history, with different philosophies, values, and areas of focus rising and falling in popularity – none consistent throughout or representative of the whole community, but fluctuating and developing through community discussions and dialogues. Above all other qualities of the movement, this lack of deterministic authority and communal openness to change maturation, and development of what it means to be a “Quantified Selfer” might be of the most seminal importance to understanding it authentically.



On Ethnographic Sources
The vast majority of my ethnographic material is drawn from blog postings, essays, interviews in journalistic publications and newspapers, and filmed presentations created by people who make up the dedicated core of the movement. They are the leaders and avid participants, the organisers and enthusiasts, the writers and researchers. You will notice a repetition of names throughout my work: individuals like Kevin Kelly, Gary Wolf, Ernesto Ramirez, Konstantin Augemberg, Larry Smarr, gwern branwen [sic], and Buster Benson, among others, are all continuously cited across its chapters. The dominance of their voices is due to the dominance of their influence across the Quantified Self community, and the extensive efforts they put into writing and publishing about it. I recognise that this leaves my analysis vulnerable as an inaccurate representation of the more common or “typical” Quantified Selfer who may not widely promote their beliefs and philosophies about self-tracking in publicly accessible places. However, there is no “normal” when it comes to the Quantified Self movement – its membership is characterised by a wide diversity of opinions, habits, and levels of involvement. I have done my best to cast my net wide in selecting blogs, recorded talks, and stories to quote from and analyse – presenting accounts ranging the “thought leaders” who upload every detail of their day to public websites, to those who have only dabbled in a single experiment of self-quantification. Yet I concede my sources are limited to those who have chosen to freely share their experiences over the internet, a potentially self-selecting group. I have also likely left out the voices of many slightly less prominent “thought leaders,” simply by limitation of the sheer number of them heading up different factions of the community, and that their opinions overlapped with those already represented. I have to some degree relied on the insights of anthropologists who are able to be physically present at Quantified Self meet-ups and conferences, primarily the work of Dawn Nafus and Jamie Sherman, and Adam Butterfield. Their expressed insights about the community, after engaging with people face-to-face and conducting many interviews, I believe grants them considerable legitimacy as second-hand ethnographic sources. -->

The Self-Tracker Identity
Identifying as a “Quantified Selfer” (the predominant self-referentially used term) requires two things; first, a lifestyle based around tracking data about oneself, and second, a conscious willingness to identity as such 3

3  Throughout this thesis I will use the terms “Quantified Selfer,” “Self Quantifier,” “quantifier,” “self- tracker,” and “tracker” interchangeably. This is based on the way I found those five terms to be used within the ethnographic material of the Quantified Self community. For the purposes of this paper you should assume they all refer to the same social identity being discussed here.

Being an identified Quantified Selfer is voluntary and self-assigned. An ownership of their tracking activity as a significant aspect of who they believe themselves to be. It is a public expression of a set of values and ideals that privately can hold a wide variety of meanings. Beyond the core belief in seeking self-improvement through collecting data, the rest is left up to the individual: track what you want, how you want, and do what you like with the data (Wolf 2010a). This open-ended invitation to have total agency of your own self-tracking lifestyle makes involvement and membership in the movement exceedingly undefined. What exactly it means to be a Quantified Selfer falls on a wide spectrum, and there are degrees to which a person can identify with and be involved in the community. Those who present at conferences and actively organise meet-ups likely take the identity more seriously than those who simply wear a popular commercial tracking device and occasionally read the Quantifiedself.com blog posts. Essentially, the level of involvement is flexible and the line between being a Quantified Selfer or not is fuzzy at best. This grey-area around what counts as being a “member” of the tracking movement requires some clarification as to who exactly I am discussing in this research. Therefore, I wish to clarify that am considering the baseline of membership to be an explicit, public and purposeful ownership of being a Quantified Selfer

Despite the wide variety of forms being a Quantified Selfer can take, and the insistence by community members that there is no such thing as an “average” self-tracker, they certainly perceive a certain type of person to be drawn to the movement (Augemberg 2013a). They describe people who join as “curious” and “goal-oriented or problem-solving
oriented” (Christensen 2013). Many come from a science-minded perspective and are interested in “poking, prodding, and measuring as a way to go about the world” (Cornell 2010). Though inspired by scientific curiosity, they also revel in questioning existing mainstream social institutions like biomedicine and technoscience, believing their practices go against the grain of “normal” society. They repeatedly speak about themselves in narratives and terms that imply independence, difference, rebelliousness, radical thinking, and being defiant of the status quo, such as being self-proclaimed “pioneers” (Kelly 2011; Wolf 2010a). Joining the movement seems to be more likely if you possess these certain character traits, but community members also suggest being part of the movement strengthens these qualities and subsequently changes the kind of lives people lead. Augemberg argues that the practice of self-tracking, Quantified Selfers become “different from other people with regard to mentality, psychological traits, lifestyle, and behaviours” (Augemberg 2013a). There is no doubt the movement understands itself as a social collective of like-minded individuals sharing an established set of values, qualifying them as a community.



Shifting Norms
Back in 2010 – the relative “early years” of the movement – Wolf wrote of extreme quantifiers considering their behaviour to be “abnormal,” and calling themselves “outliers” (Wolf 2010a). While the community still associates with leading lifestyles that deviate from the norm, many are experiencing a shift in the previously bizarre becoming more acceptable. Compulsive recordings of bodily numbers are no longer necessarily characterised as some form of anxiety disorder or signal of a lack of mental stability (Wolf 2010a). Still, in his ethnography Butterfield found self-trackers reported reluctance to divulge the full extent their tracking habits to those outside the movement, fearing they may be stigmatised and labeled “obsessive compulsive, self- absorbed, or a hypochondriac” (Butterfield 2012: 60). They report others in their lives label them “weird,” and yet simultaneously are assured that “soon everybody is going to be doing this, and you won’t even notice” (Wolf 2010a). The movement’s expansion seemingly instills confience that greater social acceptance is on the way. It therefore greatly serves the interests of those within the movement to promote the self-tracking lifestyle as increasingly normal and ordinary.
Many of the outspoken leaders of the movement are, naturally, quite optimistic about its potential rising popularity. Kelly sees the next century as leading us into an age of quantification; he believes industry will spur a new side to science and a new kind of lifestyle. He sees “new money, new tools, and a new philosophy stemming from measuring your whole life... It will be the new normal” (Kelly 2011). As this shift continues, it creates an interesting interplay with the dominant narratives that Quantified Selfers tell themselves about being “pioneering self- trackers” (Kelly 2011). How they will maintain this core aspect of their collective identity if indeed their prediction of going mainstream is fulfilled remains to be seen.


Self-Producing Pioneers
Fittingly, one intriguing quality of Quantified Selfers is the high number who are also the creators, inventors, and developers of self-tracking tools. In line with their philosophy of self- customisation and personalisation in the practice of self-tracking, it makes sense that many feel it is worth developing their own tools to serve their own specific interests and needs. Described as “technophiles, founders, and early adopters,” they engage in both the production and the use of their technological tools – a continuous, circular feedback system (Dembosky 2011; Maqubela 2012). As most work in the industry of producing technological goods, they already have the skills and knowledge to do so. The New York meet-up survey cited earlier found that 30% of their members either work for a self-tracking related company or have created a self- quantification tool (Paulus 2013). Being both the creators and consumers of cutting edge tools and technological advancements legitimises their “pioneer” self-image to an extent. They closely follow not only the new commodified gadgets and software applications that emerge on the market, but also the advances in computational power systems one step removed from the public eye – inventions that could lead to possible new ways of integrating technologies into the self. They are inventing entirely new devices to integrate into their bodies, leading the frontier of technological development in an effort to be even more enmeshed in the digital age of enhancement. In this role they are shaping the forms and purposes of the technology that “trickles down” to the rest of us in the mainstream hordes of technological consumerism. We should especially care about what they find significant, important, and meaningful - because to an extent they hold the power to determine what kind of technology we will use, and what we will use it for. There are concerns that should be raised around this form of power, especially considering the limited demographic of WEIRD individuals that currently make up the majority of the community. The political and social repercussions in areas such as healthcare and access across socioeconomic lines will be expanded upon later on.

<IntroParagraph>

The **Cozy web** is <a href="https://venkateshrao.com/">Venkatesh Rao</a>'s term for the private, gatekeeper bounded spaces of the internet we have all retreated to over the last few years.

</IntroParagraph>

Venkat first proposed the term in one of his _Breaking Smart_ emails on <a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe">The Extended Internet Universe</a>, and mentioned Yancey Strickler's companion idea of <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1">the **Dark Forest**</a>

Loving both of these notions, I felt compelled to bring them together into an illustrated diagram of our current Social Internet Situation.

<br />

    alt="Layered diagram of the cozy web as a series of underground burrows beneath the dark forest"

We create tiny underground burrows of Slack channels, Whatsapp groups, Discord chats, and Telegram streams that offer shelter and respite from the aggressively public nature of Facebook, Twitter, and every recruiter looking to connect on LinkedIn.

It's the digital realm of <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/series/domestic-cozy/">Domestic Cozy</a> Gen-Z vibes.  
Casual, comfy, and not trying to kick up a fuss.

The cozy web works on "(human) protocol of everybody cutting-and-pasting bits of text, images, URLs, and screenshots across live streams", hopefully one day evolving "from cut-and-paste to a personal blockchain of context-permissioned, addressable, searchable, interlinked clips" as Venkat puts it.

It's since become a standard part of the Venkat Vocabulary for fellow Ribbonfarmers and Yaks, and remains one of my favourite [[Neologisms]] of this year.

#### I got the chance to chat with <a href='https://www.henryzoo.com'>Henry Zhu</a> on his <a href="https://maintainersanonymous.com/">Maintainers Anonymous</a> podcast.

</SmallCenter>

It's a show about people who maintain things in the world. Whether it's code, cities, infrastructure, or museum archives, someone has to keep the decks clean and the engine stoked.

I'm not a maintainer (the only thing I reliably maintain is an obsessive tea habit), but I went on to chat to Henry about the overlap between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source-software_movement">open source software</a> and the anthropological theory of [[Gift Economies]].

Gift theory, reciprocity, and economic anthropology are all side obsessions of mine. I originally trained as a cultural anthropologist, and it's still an enormous part of how I understand and operate in the world.

Like any good cult, once you're indoctrinated you can never leave.

/>

</div>

Henry and I began discussing the parallels between gift economies and open source software (OSS) last summer.

At the time I barely knew anything about OSS. Which made me fairly typical. 99.9% of the world haven't a clue about the rich, dramatic cultural history of Linux, or Xerox PARC, or the browser wars. Despite the fact 99.9% of the software we all depend upon is built using open source projects. It's invisibility and pervasiveness alone makes it worth a closer look.

Henry earned his stripes in the OSS world as the core maintainer of [[Babel]] - an open-source javascript [[transpiler]] that's used by the vast majority of javascript-based websites.

The Babel project, and Henry as its steward, is a fascinating case study in the open source software economy and where it's headed.

<IntroParagraph>

Between IoT botnet attacks, Bitcoin ransomware, and the weekly cadence of high-profile data breaches, doing anything on the internet feels like playing Russian Roulette.

</IntroParagraph>

And that's just for normal people using it.

If you're a developer, you're partially **responsible** for protecting all those normal people from the horrors of whatever [LulzSec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LulzSec) are up to right now. The least you can do is make sure your website isn't an accessory to their nefarious activities.

Thankfully, you do not have to brave the black hat darkness alone.

[Mike Sherov](https://twitter.com/mikesherov) made an [egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/web-security-essentials-mitm-csrf-and-xss) course that covers a whole series of web security essentials

<a

    <ImageFrame

    />
</a>

I am (thankfully) not responsible enough for anyone to put me in charge of security for an important website. But I was still curious.

I wanted to know what the current landscape of internet risk looks like. How, _exactly_, is LulzSec going to hack into my mainframe in 2020?

Here's my illustrated notes from Mike's course that should give you a big picture overview of what to should look out for.

<img
    alt="Web security essentials - Let's look at three common attacks"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_780/v1592262535/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/websecurity/web-security-1.png"
/>

Turns out there's a small set of fairly well-known and easy to defend attacks that we can protect ourselves from:

-   Man in the Middle (MITM)
-   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
-   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Shielding yourself from these three is a great starting point. It's at least enough to keep the [script kiddies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie) out.

<img
    alt="First, man in the middle is a piece of software that intercepts data between a client and a server"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_900/v1592262537/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/websecurity/web-security-2.png"
/>

<img
    alt="If this connection is over HTTP all your data packets are readable cleartext. Anyone on the network can use a packet sniffer to see your data. Instead we use HTTPS to encrypt packets."

/>

<img

/>

<img

/>

<img
    alt="This is possible because browsers send cookies between sites by default. How to protect yourself. Cookies come with a 'sameSite' property that prevents them from being passed between sites. Set it to 'lax' or 'strict'"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_900/v1592262536/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/websecurity/web-security-4.png"
/>

<img
    alt="Cross-site scripting is an attack that injects malicious code into a trusted site. This can happen is the site allows user input to appear on the page without validating or encoding it. Protect yourself with a content security policy which manages which types of resources are allowed to load and where"

/>

Keeping out this trio of attacks will go a long way.

If (unlike me) you _are_ responsible enough to be in charge of security for a moderately-sized website, it might be worth double checking you have these protections in place.

Better safe than sorry. Especially when sorry means you end up on the front page of Hacker News in this week's edition of obviously preventable security breaches.

[xState](https://xstate.js.org/) is a snazzy way to manage JavaScript application state using visual state charts.
It's a pretty wonderful tool for making sure you think through every possible edge case of an application.

There's also a handy [visualiser tool](https://xstate.js.org/viz/) that synchronizes your code and visuals. If you edit one, the other changes to match. <span aria-role="image">✨</span>

<ImageFrame

<br />

It's perfect for visual thinkers. If someone could just build one of these for the entire of JavaScript I'll be all set.

Here's a little more illustrated detail on how this works:

I got to see inside the Vue-machine a little while working through [Laurie Barth](https://twitter.com/laurieontech)'s [egghead course](https://egghead.io/courses/a-journey-with-vue-router) on how to set up routes between Vue pages and components.

I made a few illustrated notes on the main concepts

<IntroParagraph>

The <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust programming language</a> keeps winning the middle-school popularity contest of the developer world: "most loved" on <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology">Stack Overflow surveys</a>.

</IntroParagraph>

<ImageFrame
    alt="Chart showing rust at the top of the rankings for most loved languages with 83.5%"
    width="80%"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_750/v1592262509/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/wtf-rust/stackoverflow.png"
/>

So, what's this Rust thing and why is everyone enamoured?  
Let's explore...

<img
    alt="Rust is a programming language mainly used to build 'system software.' Which means any software that acts as a platform for other software to run on top of it. iOS, linux, and windows are all system software. Rust is also becoming popular for making web apps. We can compile rust files into web assembly, which lets us run them in the browser."
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_960/v1592262462/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/wtf-rust/WTFRust_2.png"
/>

<img
    alt="The power of rust is that it balances speed and safety. Safety here means memory safety. Mishandling how we store data on physical microchips can lead to bugs and security flaws. High-level languages are abstract and safer. Low-level languages work directly with memory, making them dangerous but fast. Rust lives in the happy middle ground"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_960/v1592262462/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/wtf-rust/WTFRust_4.png"
/>

This happy balance Rust manages to strike – between speed, control over memory, and human-friendliness is what makes it so popular.

The kind of programmes you can write with Rust would otherwise be made in a language like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>. A lot of developers find the C-suite challenging to work with, so this friendly alternative is very welcome!

> It's got the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle'>Goldilocks Effect</a> going on. Not too slow, not too dangerous, not too complicated – just right.

The Rust community is also infamous for being welcoming, open, and encouaging to newcomers. Fostering that kind of culture is very likely why it's gained so much traction in the last few years.

Anyone who hangs out in Developer World long enough realises frameworks and languages are identities much more than they're tools. You _belong_ to Team React, or Camp Python, or the Rust Crew.

And no one wants to join a bunch of judgey gatekeepers.

I've just done a sweeping and completely incomplete overview of Rust here. But it's enough to point you in the right direction. There's plenty more to explore.

<p>
    While researching and making these I watched{" "}
    <a href="https://twitter.com/PascalPrecht">Pascal Precht</a>'s new egghead
    course that shows you how to{" "}

Pascal covers more specific details like how Rust handles variables, mutability, functions, pointers, borrowing, loops, and errors.

If you're curious to start Rusting, worth taking a look.

More illustrated notes, this time on [Gatsby themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes/).

They're one of the newer features in [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) – little building blocks of site functionality you can mix n' match n' share on NPM.

[Chris Biscardi](https://twitter.com/chrisbiscardi) made [an extensive course](https://egghead.io/courses/composable-gatsby-themes) on egghead on how to build your own.

This whole site is built in Gatsby so I'm always trying to level up my understanding of how it works under the hood. Makes it easier to play.

My <a noTip href="/drawinginvisibles1">process for making these</a> usually sticks to Procreate, Adobe Illustrator, and Photoshop <Footnote idName={1}>You can read more [here](/apps) on what tools and hardware I use</Footnote>, but I experimented with some 3D rendering in Cinema 4D for this one. Certainly sped up the process a bit, though made the final look a little more stiff than usual. Trade offs.

<IntroParagraph>

Being humans, we rarely learn things linearly. No one begins their JavaScript journey by reading [the TC39 language specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) line-by-line like a pedantic masochist.

</IntroParagraph>

```javascript
let banana = "banana";
let apple = "apple";

console.log(banana);
console.log(apple);
```

Instead we all cobble together a good-enough understanding, leaving holes here and there to fill in later.

So far I've stumbled along without 100% grokking prototypical inheritance, or how `call, apply,` and `bind` work on functions.

It's fine. Stuff mostly works. Until it doesn't ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

But at some point, it's useful to stop stumbling about and peek back at those holes.

<IntroParagraph>

Last year the [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) team released a feature called "hooks" that lets you do some powerful stuff we couldn't do as easily before... Managing state. Accessing DOM elements. Using side effects.

</IntroParagraph>

It's fair to say the React community had a collective melt-down over this. For the better part of 2019, hooks turned into an all-encompassing obsession.

Hooks came with a bunch of pre-made options, but also allowed you to remix the default options to create **custom hooks**

## Let's talk about **immutable data**

</Center>

![A robot and a pair of socks](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_500/v1592262593/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/immer/robo-socks.png)

With socks. And personal assistant bots.  
I know, you're already so excited.

**Immutability** and **state** are two developer buzzwords it took me forever to "get."

Their underlying meanings aren't necessarily that complex.  
But it's tough to fully comprehend what they mean, and why they're important, until you see them in action.

[State](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)>) just means the way an application is at a single point in time.

For example, if we've typed _"how does CSS grid work"_ into the search bar, and there are three checkboxes ticked, and we have a dropdown menu open that's the current "state" of things.  
If we close the menu that's a state change.

Behind the scenes in apps we have to account for every state an app could be in (which gets expontential very quicky). This is usually called ["managing state"](https://codeburst.io/state-management-in-javascript-15d0d98837e1) and appears to be a [neverending problem](https://medium.com/razroo/the-history-of-javascript-state-management-in-2019-161491d588ed)

---

### **Immutable State** is one approach to solving our complex state problem – it simply means making a second copy of things before you change them.

It's the same as copying and pasting a new _ImportantThing_Version2_Draft.md_ document before liberally changing enourmous chunks of it.
Then when you realise your poor editing choices and want to go back to the original version, it's there waiting for you.

Writing [immutable code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object) is a [wildly](https://medium.com/tribalscale/understanding-immutability-fdd627b66e58) [popular](https://itnext.io/why-concept-of-immutability-is-so-damn-important-for-a-beginner-front-end-developer-8da85b565c8e) concept in general. And a good idea when you don't want to muck everything up.

---

Okay now you're all caught up on the jargon. Lets get to some illustrated notes.

These are from a course [Michel Weststrate](https://twitter.com/mweststrate) made about their elegant new tool [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction) – it helps handle manage immutable state in a sane way.

    />

Michel walks us through building a gifting app with React & Immer that seamlessly handles all the messy state work.

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is undoubtedly one of the popular kids on the Web Development playground right now.

If you haven't heard of GraphQL, the TLDR is that it's a new way to request data from an API. <Footnote idName={1}>If you're unsure what an API is, head on over to my illustrated article on [WTF is an API?](/api)</Footnote>

</span>

</TwoColumn>

One that's easier, faster, better, and stronger than the old [RESTful API system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)

If you're lucky enough to already grok GraphQL, you'll know the _QL_ stands for _Query Language_ – aka. the language we talk to our GraphQL API in.

It's not a terribly complex language, but you'll still need to do some syntax studying to get the hang of it.

Thankfully the magnificent [Eve Porcello](https://twitter.com/eveporcello) made an [egghead course](https://egghead.io/courses/graphql-query-language) that runs you through the full GraphQL vocabulary.

</a>

It's a wonderful introduction for anyone new to the GraphQL ecosystem – Eve explains all the parts of the playground interface that are not in the least bit intuitive. I'd been stumbling about in my own GraphQL queries lost and afraid until I worked through this.

Anyways, as usual I drew some things:

Every year JavaScript gets a handful of new features and functions for everyone to play with.

The [TC39 committee](https://tc39.es/) have released the 2019 additions to [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/tc39.htm), which is the generally accepted version of JavaScript we all know and ~~love~~ tolerate.

You can take a look at the [TC39 Github](https://github.com/tc39) to track the progress of proposed features, including all the ones they've [accepted into the official language](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md).

I drew up my own notes on the 7 big changes below:

-   Optional Catch Binding
-   Stable `array.sort()`
-   Flatten Arrays with `flat()`
-   Flatten & Map Arrays with `flatMap()`
-   Cut out Whitespace with `trimStart()` & `trimEnd()`
-   Descriptions on Symbols
-   Create Objects from Entries with `fromEntries()`

These notes are all based off Mike Sherov's egghead course on [Javascript ES2019 in Practice](https://egghead.io/courses/javascript-es2019-in-practice?af=54fd64) which is a good summary of all the new shiny bits, as well as how they apply in IRL dev situations.

<IntroParagraph>

If you've been keeping up with the sweetest new static-site generation tools, you'll have heard of the JAMstack. <Footnote idName={1}>And if you havent, don't worry it's a niche web developer thing - <a href="https://jamstack.wtf/">Jamstack WTF</a> explains it pretty well.</Footnote>

</IntroParagraph>

The TLDR here is that combining Javascript, APIs, and Markup (JAM) makes it easy to build sites that work well across all kinds of devices and data loading speeds. Which, like jam, makes everyone happy.

![A stack of jam toast](https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_300/v1592855269/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/gatsby-contentful/thumb_2x.png)

Two popular tools for building JAMstack sites are [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/). Gatsby is a framework for building the actual site, and Contentful is a Content Management System (CMS) - aka. where you stick all the images, text, and data.

[Khaled Garbaya](https://khaledgarbaya.net/) created a whole [egghead course](https://egghead.io/courses/build-content-rich-progressive-web-apps-with-gatsby-and-contentful) that walks you through hooking these two up

<IntroParagraph>

The _intantness_ of chat apps has always been a mystery to me.  
The technical details of moving emojis through The Internet Pipes and across continents in 0.004 miliseconds is well beyond my paygrade.

</IntroParagraph>

But I got a tiny window of insight into the magic while illustrating notes for [Mark Barton's course](https://egghead.io/courses/vue-and-socket-io-for-real-time-communication) on building chat apps with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

    />
</a>

Turns out it's not magic, but instead done through [websockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). Which are like little portals that hold open a consistent connection between two machines.

I obviously still haven't a clue what goes on inside that dark little portal. Thankfully using tools like Vue & Socket.io save us from that level of depth.

<IntroParagraph>

Turns out you can build almost anything in React now... including VR and AR apps inside a web browser.

</IntroParagraph>

There's a version of React called [React 360](https://facebook.github.io/react-360/) that simplifies the otherwise niche and overly-complex challenge of making things fly around in virtual 3D space.

</div>

</TwoColumn>

[Tomasz Lakomy](https://egghead.io/instructors/tomasz-lakomy) made an entire egghead course that walks you through building [VR Applications Using React 360](https://egghead.io/courses/vr-applications-using-react-360).

<IntroParagraph>

If you've build anything on the modern web, you've used [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

</IntroParagraph>

Nothing works without it. When I first started learning web development I didn't pay much attention to it. But once I got deeper into learning [[JSX]] and React (more on that in my [[React is a Potato]] talk) and I needed a to understand what was up with the all the `.babelrc` files in my projects.

Here's my quick one-shot summary of it:

<BasicImage
    width="860px"
    alt="Babel is a translator that turns different varieties of JS into ES5 - a commonly shared version"

If you've had the pleasure of trying to stumble your way through learning React, you'll have been through the adjustment phase with JSX. Putting HTML and JS side-by-side feels like it's violating the internet rules at first. It's just a new mashup - an awkward lovechild.

<IntroParagraph>

When I was first [[learning React]] I couldn't quite wrap my head around why it was any different to JavaScript.

</IntroParagraph>

The idea of the virtual DOM system helped clarify a few things for me. Primarily it got me to understand the DOM, the virtual DOM, and your React app are all separate systems talking to one another. Not one big mesh. While learning it I drew out an explanation you can see below.

This post is slightly dated, and the React team isn't keen on the term **"Virtual DOM"** as a mental model for how React works under the hood.

https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1066328666341294080

Instead Dan wrote up a nice long explanation on [React as a UI Runtime](https://overreacted.io/react-as-a-ui-runtime/) which clarifies the details how React updates the UI.

They still have a section of the docs about the [Virtual DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html), but it's not an essential piece of the React ecosystem to learn about.

The below explanation will still help you understand the basic concept that React figures out what needs to change on the DOM before changing it, but go to other sources if you want a more in-depth explanation.

<IntroParagraph>

Spreading the elements from one array and copying them into is one of those handy shorthands for moving data around in JavaScript.

</IntroParagraph>

I started looking into it after seeing `<ComponentName {...props} />` in lots of React projects, and couldn't figure out what on earth was going on with the props syntax.

Mystery solved...

We have become so accustomed to reading the web in reverse chronological order, few of us can imagine presenting information any other way.

Facebook pioneered this pattern in 2006 when they implemented the newsfeed.

## Hundreds of feature illustrations for the web development courses on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/)

Between 2015 and 2021 I was the art director and lead illustrator at egghead – a learning website for web developers.

For every course we released, I created a unique illustration that captured the main concept. We used these across our website to help users browse visually, as well as for marketing and promoting the courses.

I made over 250 of these illustrations. Here's a small selection...

## A distinctive speedometer illustration for the Google Chrome team.

    Addy Osmani from the Google Chrome team got in touch when they needed a new
    design for their Speedometer tool. The tool tests how fast a web app
    responds, given a pile of simulated user interactions like mouse movemenets,
    clicks, and keyboard input.{" "}
</p>

<p>
    The team wanted a distinctive illustrated badge of a speedometer to use
    across the website and branding. Given my love of finely-rendered mechanical
    details, the project was a great fit.
</p>

</TwoColumn>

I developed three different speedometeres for the team to pick from – each used subtle visual cues related to Chrome and JavaScript.

## A shirt design to celebrate the <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> library hitting 50,000 Github stars.

The React development team contacted me to help design a shirt. They were approaching 50,000 stars 💫 on Github and wanted to commemorate with a limited-edition shirt.

/>

<br />

### Exploration & Concepting

The first challenge was to figure out a cental design idea for the shirt.
We knew there were core principals the design should communicate – React is powerful, flexible, and immensely popular in the development community.

I did an initial round of 360° brainstorming of all the directions we could take it.

/>

<br />

### Making Choices & Refining Designs

After reviewing the possible directions with the team, we decided the 'reactive' volcano design both expressed React's core themes and worked as a simple and strong visual.

From there I explored more subtle shifts in design elements, details, and composition options. Vectorising the primary shapes helps make these small experiments fast and easy, and lays the groundwork for the final vectors.

<p>At the beginning of 2018, Kent C. Dodds came to our team at <a href="https://egghead.io">egghead</a> with an ambitious project. A collection of 8 courses bundled into a single online learning platform – all of them focused on techniques for testing Javascript code.

I led the art direction and created illustrations for the project, while my design partner <a href="https://vojta.io/">Vojta Holik</a> did all the UI and development work.</p>

    The testing trophy illustration became the central visual identity for the
    course. We ended up using it as the featured image on the landing page, and
    across social media graphics.

## Module Illustrations

The course included eight modules that each needed an individual illustration. To make sure they all felt like a unified set, I established a common colour palette, and consistent shape language.
